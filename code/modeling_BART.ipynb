The prominent myometrial/periuterine vessels seen in patients with LIPS are indistinguishable from the findings in those with AVMs (2) . Therefore, because it is a rare diagnosis that is fundamentally histopathological (5,7) and little discussed in the radiology literature, it is likely that LIPS also accounts for a portion of the cases of overdiagnosis (4) and unconfirmed diagnosis of AVMs. Nevertheless, AVM is still rarer than in LIPS (2,6) .In summary, when there is postpartum vaginal bleeding in a patient with normal b-HCG values and a finding of uterine hypervascular focal alteration, an endometrial component (RPOC) should first be excluded. When this differentiation is not clear, and especially when anomalous dilated myometrial vessels are detected in the adjacent areas, a diagnosis of LIPS accompanied by RPOC should be considered as a possible alternative to that of AVMs. The diagnosis of AVM can be confirmed by digital angiography, or the differentiation between the two diagnoses can be made through pathological study (1,4) .\",\n          \"The composition of municipal wastewater and sewage sludge reflects the use and proliferation of elements and contaminants within society. In Sweden, official statistics show that concentrations of toxic metals in municipal sewage sludge have steadily decreased, by up to 90 %, since the 1970s, due to environmental programmes and statutory limits on metals in sludge and soil. Results from long-term field experiments show that reduced metal pollution during repeated sewage sludge application has reversed negative trends in soil biology. Despite this Swedish success story, organic waste recycling from Swedish towns and cities to arable land is still limited to only about 20 % of the total amount produced. Resistance among industries and consumers to products grown on land treated with sewage sludge may not always be scientifically grounded; however, there are rational obstacles to application of sewage sludge to land based on its inherent properties rather than its content of pollutants. We argue that application of urban organic wastes to soil is an efficient form of recycling for small municipalities, but that organic waste treatment from large cities requires other solutions. The large volumes of sewage sludge collected in towns and cities are not equitably distributed back to arable land because of the following: (i) The high water and low nutrient content in sewage sludge make long-distance transportation too expensive; and (ii) the low plant availability of nutrients in sewage sludge results in small yield increases even after many years of repeated sludge addition. Therefore, nutrient extraction from urban wastes instead of direct organic waste recycling is a possible way forward. The trend for increased combustion of urban wastes will make ash a key waste type in future. Combustion not only concentrates the nutrients in the ash but also leads to metal enrichment; hence, direct application of the ash to land is most often not possible.However, inorganic fertiliser (e.g. mono-ammonium phosphate fertiliser, MAP) can be produced from metalcontaminated sewage sludge ash in a process whereby the metals are removed. We argue that the view on organic waste recycling needs to be diversified in order to improve the urban-rural nutrient cycle, since only recycling urban organic wastes directly is not a viable option to close the urban-rural nutrient cycle. Recovery and recycling of nutrients from organic wastes are a possible solution. When organic waste recycling is complemented by nutrient extraction, some nutrient loops within society can be closed, enabling more sustainable agricultural production in future.\",\n          \"Aims and objectives: To examine the nature and use of automation in contemporary clinical information systems by reviewing studies reporting the implementation and evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in healthcare settings.Method: PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, the tables of contents of major informatics journals, and the bibliographies of articles were searched for studies reporting evaluation of AI in clinical settings from January 2021 to December 2022.We documented the clinical application areas and tasks supported, and the level of system autonomy.Reported effects on user experience, decision-making, care delivery and outcomes were summarised.Results: AI technologies are being applied in a wide variety of clinical areas.Most contemporary systems utilise deep learning, use routinely collected data, support diagnosis and triage, are assistive (requiring users to confirm or approve AI provided information or decisions), and are used by doctors in acute care settings in high-income nations.AI systems are integrated and used within existing clinical information systems including electronic medical records.There is limited support for One Health goals.Evaluation is largely based on quantitative methods measuring effects on decision-making.Conclusion: AI systems are being implemented and evaluated in many clinical areas.There remain many opportunities to understand patterns of routine use and evaluate effects on decision-making, care delivery and patient outcomes using mixed-methods.Support for One Health including integrating data about environmental factors and social determinants needs further exploration.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3975,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Introduction  Organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) are organic derivatives of phosphoric acid, phosphonic acid, phosphorothioic acid, or phosphonothioic acids (Corbett, 1974;Espinoza-Navarro et al., 2017;Eco and Zweig, 2018). Up until now, Organophosphorus pesticides are one of the most commonly used pesticide classes in agriculture in the management of insect pests due to their high efficacy, comparatively high dissipation, and low persistence compared to other pest class pesticides (Gonz\\u00e1lez-Curbelo et al., 2012;Eco and Zweig, 2018). More often, pesticides are misused, including overdoses, adulterated formulas, and harvesting without a minimum waiting period (Herrera-Herrera et al., 2019). The extensive use of pesticides can contaminate both the atmosphere and food, leading to health problems (Sultana and Nakagoshi, 2001;Islam et al., 2009). In OPPs, extensive exposure to higher concentrations can lead to cardiovascular, nervous, respiratory, metabolic, reproductive, and even immune symptoms problems (Joshi and Sharma, 2011;Espinoza-Navarro et al., 2017). Besides, these groups of compounds are likely to change embryonic health and lead children to ADHD (Hassani et al., 2017). The toxicity of OPPs metabolites is much more toxic than the parent compound itself. Thus, OPPs are known to be the most toxic class of pesticides in insects, animals, and humans (Hassani et al., 2017). According to the USA pesticide usage database, the most frequently used OPPs are malathion, dimethoate, chlorpyrifos, acephate, naled, diazinon, methyl-parathion, dicrotophos, phorate, phosmet, and azinphos-methyl (Grube et al., 2011). In the developing world, pesticide selection is mostly older, broadspectrum, organophosphate and carbamate class, because of their acute toxicity and they are also cheaper than the newer types (Sultana and Nakagoshi, 2001 Bangladesh is a land of agriculture and many farmers cultivate vegetables in their home garden and in the field on a commercial basis (Chowdhury et al., 2011). In Bangladesh, eggplant and cauliflower are one of the healthiest, most nutritious, a widely consumed vegetable as it is available all year round and has an attractive taste (BARI, 2013;Amin et al., 2018). In Bangladesh, farmers have frequently used pesticides to ensure the quality and higher yields of vegetables (Dasgupta et al., 2007). The most alarming concern is that farmers of Bangladesh often spray hazardous pesticide like OPPs up to five to six times than the recommended dosage in one crop growing season (Sultana and Nakagoshi, 2001;Dasgupta et al., 2007). In recent years, eggplant and cauliflower cultivation have become expensive and risky for farmers and consumers due to the increased use of chemical pesticides to control pests (Srinivasan, 2008). Also, in most areas of Bangladesh, vegetables are marketed without maintaining a pre-harvest interval period. These market vegetables often contain pesticide residues due to overuse on the farm, which has adverse effects on human health (Dasgupta et al., 2007;Chowdhury et al., 2011;Nahar et al., 2020). A study found that eggplant is the most pesticide residue contained vegetable, which is the reason for the vegetable export reduction . In order to ensure consumer safety, most countries have established a maximum residue limit (MRL) and an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of pesticide residues in food items (Chowdhury et al., 2011). The impact of daily intakes of pesticide residues in food should be measured by an exposure or risk assessment.  In the present study, seven mostly used organophosphorus pesticides (acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, fenitrothion, malathion, and quinalphos) were selected to determine the level of residues in eggplant and cauliflower marketed in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. This study also aimed to assess the short-term and long long-term health risks to consumers posed by these pesticide residues.   Materials and methods   Chemicals  The standard (>99.6% pure) of acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, fenitrothion, malathion, and quinalphos were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA) via Bangladesh Scientific Pvt. Ltd. Dhaka, Bangladesh. Analytical grade methanol, acetone, HPLC grade acetonitrile, sodium chloride (NaCl), anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4 ), and Primary Secary Amine (PSA) were purchased from Bangladesh Scientific Pvt. Ltd.   Study area  The study area included five major markets of Dhaka city, the capital of Bangladesh (Figure 1). It is one of the biggest megacities with 20 million peoples and located in the central point of the country. This study was conducted by collecting eggplant and cauliflower for pesticide residues from major vegetable markets of Dhaka city. The Kawran Bazar, Mohammadpur Krishi Market, Mirpur-1 Bazar, Taltola Bazar and Jatrabari Bazar were considered for sample selection. These markets are famous for vegetables and other daily shopping in Dhaka city. These market vegetables are grown in different districts and certain parts of the neighbouring areas.   Sample collection  A total of 100 samples were collected (50 eggplants and 50 cauliflower). Ten eggplant samples and ten cauliflower samples were collected from each market (Kawran Bazar, Mohammadpur Krishi Market, Mirpur-1 Bazar, Taltola Bazar and Jatrabari Bazar) in Dhaka city. The amount of each vegetable samples was 1 kg. The samples were collected in individual polythene bags, and each bag has been appropriately labelled with the sample numbers and sources. The collected samples were transported on collection day to the Pesticide Analytical Laboratory of Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI), Gazipur. Each sample was cut into small pieces and appropriately mixed for homogeneity. Then, the chopped samples were processed at -20\\u00b0C using airtight zipper bags before the extraction and clean -up process started.   Preparation of pesticide standard solution  Pesticide standard stock solutions of acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, fenitrothion, FULL PAPER malathion, and quinalphos were prepared separately in acetone at a concentration of 1000 mg/L and stored at -20\\u00b0C until use. A mixed standard solution of 50 mg/L in acetone containing all the pesticides, as mentioned above, was prepared by adding the appropriate volume of each stock solution in a 50 mL volumetric flask and made to the volume by adding acetone. An intermediate mixed standard solution of 10 mg/L in acetone was prepared from the mixed standard solution of 50 mg/L. Then working standard solutions of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 mg/L in acetone were prepared by transferring the appropriate amount from 10 mg/L intermediate mixed standard solution into ten separate 10 mL volumetric flasks. All the standard solutions were kept in a freezer at -20\\u00b0C until use.   Extraction and clean-up  In this study, the modified QuEChERS extraction technique was used to extract and cleanup the collected vegetable samples (Prodhan et al., 2015). The chopped vegetable samples were grounded thoroughly with a blender. A representative 10 g portion of the thoroughly homogenized sample was weighted in a 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube. Then 10 mL of acetonitrile (CH 3 CN) was added into the centrifuge tube. The centrifuge tube was appropriately closed and shaken vigorously for 30 secs by using a vortex mixer. Then, 4 g of anhydrous MgSO 4 and 1 g of NaCl were added into the centrifuge tube, and it was shaken immediately by the vortex mixer for 1 min to prevent the formation of magnesium sulfate aggregates. Afterwards, the extract was centrifuged for 5 mins at 5000 rpm. An aliquot of 3 mL of the CH 3 CN layer was transferred into a 15 mL centrifuge tube containing 600 mg anhydrous MgSO 4 and 120 mg Primary Secary Amine (PSA). Then it was thoroughly mixed by vortex for 30 secs and centrifuged for 5 mins at 4000 rpm (Laboratory Centrifuges, Sigma-3K30, Germany). After centrifuge, a 1 mL supernatant was filtered by a 0.2 \\u00b5m PTFE filter, and then it was taken in a clean GC vial for further analysis.   Instrumental analysis  The concentrated extracts were subjected to analysis by GC-2010 (Shimadzu) with Flame Thermionic Detector (FTD) for the detection of OPPs. The capillary column was AT-1 (30 m \\u00d7 0.25 mm \\u00d7 0.25 \\u03bcm) was used to separate the analytes. The split mode was used for injection, and the injector and detector temperature were 250\\u00b0C and 280\\u00b0C with a split ratio: 30:0. The column temperature was programmed as follows: from 150\\u00b0C for 1 min, from 150 to 220\\u00b0C for 2 mins at 10\\u00b0C/ min. Helium was used as the carrier at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min, and as a make-up gas at a flow rate of 30 mL/ min for FTD with airflow at 145 mL/min. The flow rates of Helium and air were adjusted at 1.00 Pa, with a total run time was 10 mins.   Quality assurance procedure  The experiment was validated on parameters of specificity, linearity, determination coefficient (R2), and limit of quantification (LOQ). The specificity was determined by specific retention time on the chromatogram for specific pesticide. The linearity and determination co-efficient was calculated continuously by standard fortified solutions of each pesticide at concentration levels ranged between 0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg. The limit of quantification was calculated as the lowest detection level for each pesticide. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was used to measure the sensitivity of the method.   Health risk assessment  The acute health indices (aHI) or short-term health risk to consumer (Equation 2) was measured using the estimated short-term intake (ESTI) (Equation 1) and the acute reference dose (ARfD). The chronic health risk/ hazard quotient or long-term health risk to consumers (HQ) (Equation 4) was measured using the estimated daily intake (EDI) (Equation 3) and the acceptable daily intake (ADI). The hazard quotient (HQ) indicates a potential risk if it reaches 100%, and the higher aHI/HQ value is the higher risk. For the appropriate calculation, the ARfD and ADI values expressed as an mg/kg of daily intake for a 60 kg person for seven organophosphorus pesticides were obtained from the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) database (http://apps.who.int/pesticide-residues-jmprdatabase) (JMPR, 2004;FAO/WHO, 2019). According to FAO/WHO, the average national per capita consumption of 23 g of leafy vegetables, 89 g of nonleafy vegetables, and 14 g of fruit is an average of 126 g of fruit and vegetables per day in Bangladesh (Haque et al., 2014). The equation for calculation of ESTI, aHI, HQ, and cHI were given below:   Statistical analysis  The level of pesticide residue in collected samples was analysed and calculated in mg/kg automatically by the Shimadzu GC software. All the data analyses and calculations were made by MS Excel 2013 software.    Results and discussion   Validation of the method  In order to validate the method, recovery experiments were conducted for eggplant and cauliflower control samples. The collected control samples were cut into small pieces and stored at -20 0 C until homogenization. Homogenization was done using a fruit blender. Then, the homogenized sample (10 g) was spiked prior to the determination procedure by the addition of a mixed pesticide standard working solution to prepare the fortification levels of 0.10 mg/kg. After the addition of working standard solution in the matrix, the mixture was equilibrated by shaking and the samples were allowed to settle for 30 mins prior to extraction in order to ensure sufficient contact of the desired pesticides with the matrix. Then the samples were prepared according to the method which was described earlier. Precision in case of Repeatability (RSD r ) was determined at the fortification levels of 0.10 mg/kg. The average recoveries of the selected pesticides in eggplant ranged from 82-109% with RSD \\u22649, while in the case of cauliflower it was 80-98% with RSD \\u22648. The linearity, determination coefficient (R 2 ), and LOQ were measured in an external standard solution using the peak areas obtained by GC-FTD analysis. The linear regression equation and determination coefficient (R 2 ) values and LOQ are given in Table 1. The standard curve results showed that the linearity was excellent, with a determination coefficient of R 2 value ranges from 0.9931 -0.9998. The limits of quantification (LOQs) were 0.01 mg/kg, indicating the high sensitivity of this method. The proposed method was applied to the external standard solution for assessing its specificity. The specificity of seven selected organophosphorus pesticides was performed by comparing the retention times of each pesticide presented in a typical chromatogram obtained by GC-FTD using analysis of external added standard solution and matrix solvent (Figure 2).   Pesticide residues in eggplant  Out of fifty samples of the eggplant, six samples (12% of the total number of samples) contained chlorpyrifos residue, three samples (6% of the total number of samples) contained dimethoate residue and one sample (2% of the total number of samples) contained diazinon residue ( Table 2). All detected eggplant samples contained chlorpyrifos dimethoate and diazinon residues above the European Union maximum residue limit (EU-MRLs). In the eggplant, the most frequently detected pesticide was chlorpyrifos (12%), followed by dimethoate (6%). Among the seven OPPs, acephate, fenitrothion, malathion, and quinalphos were not detected in any eggplant samples collected from five major vegetable markets of Dhaka city. These findings are comparable to Islam et al. (2014). They collected forty-two eggplant, cauliflower, and country bean samples from the fields and markets of the Narsingdi district and were fifteen samples (over 36% of the total samples) found no OPPs . The study findings were well agreed with Hasan et al. (2017). In country bean samples collected from different Dhaka markets, they have detected two kinds of insecticides (such as dimethoate and quinalphos). Out of fifty analysed country bean samples, ten samples (20%) contained dimethoate and quinalphos residues, five of which exceeded the maximum residue limits (MRLs). Most contaminated eight samples contained dimethoate residue (Hasan et al., 2017). Ahmed et al. (2017) analysed 170 samples collected from Jessore, Comilla, Narsingdi, Tangail, Rangpur, Jamalpur, Gazipur, and Dhaka for residue analysis in eggplant, yard long bean, bitter gourd, snake gourd, pointed gourd, okra, tomato, hyacinth bean, and cabbage samples. Among the one hundred seventy samples, 21.78% were contaminated with insecticides, either single or multiple residues, in which 18.26% of samples had residues above MRL (Ahmed et al., 2017). According to Figure 3, chlorpyrifos was the most frequently detected pesticide followed by dimethoate in the eggplant samples collected from 5 major vegetable markets of Dhaka city. Out of the ten eggplant samples collected from the Jatrabari Bazar only one sample contained dimethoate residue (0.08 mg/kg). Among the ten eggplant samples collected from Mirpur-    Pesticide residues in cauliflower  Out of fifty samples of cauliflower, six samples (12% of the total number of samples) contained chlorpyrifos residue, four samples (8% of the total number of samples) contained diazinon residue and one sample (2% of the total number of samples) contained quinalphos residue (Table 3). Out of 10 contaminated samples, 9 were above the European Union maximum residue limit (EU-MRLs). In the cauliflower, the most frequently detected pesticide was chlorpyrifos (12.00%), followed by diazinon (8%). Among the seven OPPs, acephate, dimethoate, fenitrothion, and malathion were not detected in any cauliflower samples. The findings of this study can also be compared to Akter et al. (2017). They found that 22% of samples contained pesticide residues of diazinon, dimethoate, quinalphos, and chlorpyrifos residues in eggplant collected from the Mymensingh district. Among the detected OPP residues, only five samples exceeded the MRL set by the EU (Aktar et al., 2017). The present study is in good agreement with Islam et al. (2019). They found that about 12% of bitter gourd samples were contaminated with different organophosphorus pesticides (Islam et al., 2019). Figure 4 shows chlorpyrifos was the most frequently detected pesticide followed by diazinon and quinalphos in cauliflower samples. Out of ten cauliflower samples collected from the Jatrabari Bazar two contained multiples OPP residues namely chlorpyrifos (0.03 and 0.18 mg/kg) and diazinon (0.094 and 0.42 mg/kg). Among the ten eggplant samples collected from Mirpur-1 Bazar, two samples contained chlorpyrifos (0.373 and 0.42 mg/kg), and one sample contained diazinon (0.033 mg/kg). Another ten samples collected from Mohammadpur Krishi Market, two samples contained chlorpyrifos (0.525 and 0.54 mg/kg), and one sample contained multiple residues namely diazinon (0.08 mg/    Risk assessment  The mean concentrations of detected OPP pesticide residues were above their corresponding MRL levels ( Table 2 and 3). The high-level residue in the eggplant samples of some OPPs is an indicator of the recent use of chlorpyrifos and dimethoate on eggplant farms especially vegetables grown and harvested very close to the city and surrounding areas. Unfortunately, these vegetables usually get high priced because they look fresh compared to vegetables that come from distant areas. The OPPs' health risk estimated in the eggplant samples were represented in Table 4. For acute or short-term risk (aHIs) analysis, all ESTI values were much lower than JMPR's ARfD values. Besides, the highest risk came from chlorpyrifos with aHI 1.454%, followed by dimethoate with aHI 0.979%. All the aHIs were so lower than 100%, which indicates there was a negligible short-term or acute risk with the exposure to the tested pesticides via eggplant consumption.  Moreover, in the chronic or long-term risk assessment, the risk quotient (HQs) was notably higher than acute risk indexes. The (HQs) due to acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, fenitrothion, and malathion in the eggplant was 0. 025, 9.931, 0.297, 6.527, 0.148, and 0.025, respectively, suggesting that peoples in Dhaka city have no significant health risk through the consumption of eggplant since all the calculated values were less than 100%. Hence, the health risk from organophosphorus pesticide residues in cauliflower was relatively smaller and they could not pose potential toxicity to the consumer. Moreover, it should be considered that these vegetable samples were analysed directly after collection without washing. Whereas, it is a common practice in Bangladesh to wash vegetable after buying and most of them also peeled and cooked before consumption. These washing, peeling and cooking practices will definitely reduce the amount of pesticide residues to a significant level (Panhwar et al., 2014;Jankowska et al., 2016;Alen et al., 2017;Prodhan et al., 2018). Therefore, it is important to consider for policymakers not to destroy these contaminated vegetable products. These samples are not allowed for international trade as fresh products due to higher MRL value but face no problem for national consumption especially when one-third of our population is suffering from malnutrition and sufficient food intake.      Conclusion  This study found that eggplant and cauliflower contained organophosphorus pesticide residues at a considerable level in major vegetable markets of the Dhaka city of Bangladesh. Among the 21 contaminated samples, 20 were above EU-MRL where chlorpyrifos was frequently detected. However, the short-term health risk or acute health indices (aHI) of organophosphorus pesticide residues by eggplant and cauliflower consumption was negligible. The observed levels of pesticide residues in the eggplant and cauliflower do not pose a serious risk to consumers, but pesticide contamination in vegetables may give rise to concern. Therefore, a routine monitoring system must be established to control the contamination of vegetables with pesticides especially vegetables grown and harvested very close to the city and surrounding areas.

By this technique, gene quantification is obtained as the result of a gene expression of interest (target gene, TG) subtracted from the expression of a normalizer gene (reference gene, RG). Such quantitation can be very useful, but the results are highly dependent on the stability of the used RG for normalization. This procedure aims to minimize technical variations inherent to the quality and quantity of RNA introduced during the extraction procedure, reverse transcription and PCR efficiency [4]. Therefore, standardization of TG expression data is crucial to minimize technical variations that may obscure and affect the results of gene expression quantification [5].  For this technique, RG involved in basic cellular coding processes of protein such as cytoskeleton construction (actin), glycolysis (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-GAPDH), protein folding (cyclophilin), synthesis of ribosomal subunits (rRNA), electron transport and ubiquitin degradation (ubiquitin-UBC) are typically used. Also, ribosomal RNA are used, such as 18S and 28S rRNA. However, an ideal RG must have stable level of expression under various experimental conditions at different stages of development, tissue type and stimuli from external environment (e.g. heat and thermal stress, immunological challenge, among others) [6].  The stability of RG can be analyzed by software that use statistical tools, such as those implemented in geNorm [7], NormFinder [8] e Bestkeeper [9] programs. These programs allow analyzing expression data obtained by RT-qPCR technique and aim to assess the stability of these genes indicating the most appropriate. Normalization procedure requires suitable amplification efficiencies of both reference and target genes [2], therefore, an appropriate choice of RG are essential. Furthermore, the use of a single RG has not been recommended, in terms that it may lead to a poor standardization [7]. According to these authors, multiple RG should be used for proper gene expression quantification. Recently, the use of multiple RG has been used and recommended as a suitable approach for TG normalization in chicken [10].  Several studies have indicated suitable RG in cattle [11], pigs [12], ovine [13], goats [14], horse [15] and fish [16,17]. Also, studies have been carried out to identify suitable RG in chickens (Gallus gallus) [10,18]. However, to date, there are no studies reported that have evaluated suitable RG as normalizer under similar conditions as proposed in this study (genetic group, sex and environment).  Considering the above, we aimed to identify stable reference genes for normalization of target genes in muscle tissue from three genetically divergent groups of chicken (Peloco, Caneluda and Cobb 500 1 ) considering the influence of environment (heat stress and comfort) and sex.    Material and methods   Ethical approval   Animals  In this study, we used 36 males and females birds, being 12 chicks of each breed (Peloco and Caneluda, backyard breeds, and Cobb 500 1 , commercial line). Commercial animals were purchased a week after the birth of backyard birds in the Universidade Estadual do Sudoeste da Bahia (UESB), Itapetinga Campus, and raised under the same environmental conditions from November 2 to December 2 of 2015 with an average temperature of 26.5\\u02daC. The predominant climate of Itapetinga region is the semi-arid, in which the temperature increases during the day and decrease during the night. Nutritional diets followed the requirements of the Brazilian Tables for Poultry and Swine [19] and the feed was produced in the poultry sector of UESB (Table 1). All birds were raised in semi-open stalls and lined with wood shavings (wood chips).   Heat stress  Heat stress was provided in two stages so that all birds had the same slaughter age (30 days). First, six birds of Peloco breed and six birds of Caneluda breed were subjected to heat stress under an average temperature of 39.5\\u02daC and environmental relative humidity of 60% for one hour. In the second stage, six birds of Cobb 500 1 line were subjected to heat stress with the same conditions of temperature and humidity for 30 minutes. During the heat stress period, animals had ad libitum access to food and water.  During the heat stress, birds were constantly observed for behavioral changes, in order to avoid deaths caused by excessive temperature. The acute heat stress was determined at the moment that most of the birds (\\u00b190%) were prostrate (lying with the abdominal faced down), and with increased respiratory rate. All birds were slaughtered by cervical dislocation after heat stress period.  All control birds (six birds of each genetic group) were slaughtered by cervical dislocation at the second stage of the experiment at 4 am (local time) to ensure thermal comfort temperature (23\\u02daC).   Tissue sampling  After slaughter, muscle tissue samples were collected from the breast (Pectoralis major), placed in cryogenic tubes, identified and stored in liquid nitrogen. Samples were transported to the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory of the Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz (UESC), separated and stored in Ultrafreezer (-80\\u02daC).    Reference genes selection and RT-qPCR optimization  Sequences of ten reference genes were selected from literature [18] and used for analysis of expression stability using RT-qPCR (Table 2). To obtain the standard curve, we used a cDNA pool of all treatments aiming to optimize and calculate the PCR efficiency. We used three cDNA concentrations (15,45 and 135ng/\\u03bcl) and three primer concentrations (200, 400, 800 mM). RT-qPCR reaction conditions were set with initial denaturation temperature at 95\\u02daC for two minutes, and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\\u02daC for 15 seconds. The extension temperature was individually standardized for each pair of primer for 60 seconds. At the end of amplification reaction, we included an additional step with gradual temperature increasing from 60 to 95\\u02daC for dissociation curve analysis. Amplification of all genes was performed in duplicate in a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Results were obtained by using the Sequence Detection Systems software (V. 2.0.6) (Applied Biosystems Foster City, CA, USA) that generated the cycle threshold (Ct) parameter. The Ct values of duplicates were obtained directly from the above program and used to calculate the average Ct and standard deviation. PCR amplification efficiency was calculated for each reference gene using the following formula: E = (10^( -1/slope)-1 ) x 100 [20]. After efficiency analysis, the most appropriate annealing temperature and primer concentration were used in PCR reactions.   Real time quantitative PCR  The RT-qPCR reaction was performed using SYBR Green detection kit with GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, EUA), using specific primers. Gene amplification was performed in duplicate using the Real Time PCR 7500 Fast system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, EUA) and the results obtained with the Sequence Detection Systems program (V.  2.0.6) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, EUA) that generated the cycle threshold (Ct) parameters.  The Ct values were exported to Microsoft Excel to calculate the Ct mean, standard deviation and the standard curve for each gene. A negative control (ultra-pure water) also was added in each assay. The qPCR reaction conditions were defined as follow: Initial denaturation at 95\\u02daC during ten minutes and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\\u02daC for 15 seconds. The extension temperature between 60 and 64\\u02daC during one minute was ideal for all primers. Ct values of control wells were excluded from subsequent analyzes as well as the undetectable values.   Determination of expression stability of reference genes  The average Ct values of reference genes were used to set the input files according to each software. To calculate the stability of reference genes, four different analysis methods were used: SLqPCR [21], NormFinder [8], Comparative Ct (\\u0394Ct) [22], and BestKeeper [9]. All analyzes were performed in the statistical environment R [23], except Bestkeeper, which was analyzed in Microsoft Excel. Analyses were performed according to authors' recommendations of each tool.  The SLqPCR is a statistical analysis package for R software [23] using the method of VAN-DESOMPELE et al. (2002). To perform the stability analysis, it is necessary to transform Ct values in relative values (Q). This method automatically calculates a measure (M) of expression stability for each control gene in a given group of samples. The lower the M value, more stable, and thus recommending a pair of RG as normalizer.  The NormFinder was used as an algorithm for R statistical environment developed by Andersen et al., (2004) and provides information on intra and inter-group variability indicating the best endogenous control [8]. This algorithm indicates the expression of the most stable Table 2. Description of Gallus gallus reference genes, their specific primers used in RT-qPCR analysis and parameters derived from RT-qPCR analysis. All primers were designed by NASCIMENTO et al., (2015). gene by the lower mean values of stability (S), identifying the reference genes according to their groups of inter and intra-expression variation, obtaining a single gene with a stable expression.   GENE GENE ID SEQUENCE (5'-3') DESCRIPTION LENGTH (PB)   ACTA1  BestKeeper analyzes the variability of reference genes expression through the Ct calculation [24]. It uses a comparative Ct that calculates gene expression changes based on relative difference between an experimental sample and normalizer [25]. Data interpretation is based on standard deviation [\\u00b1CP] that should be less than 1, on standard deviation [\\u00b1 X-Fold] being less than 2 and coefficient of correlation [r], which should be as large as possible [9]. The correlation coefficient (r) and standard deviation (SD) are the main parameters to evaluate the expression of reference genes and must be large and low, respectively [9]. Furthermore, authors suggest excluding genes that have SD above 1.5. They do not indicate the importance of each measurement, leaving to researcher's criteria the decision to choose which parameter will be used. Based on these previous studies, it was decided to use only the SD to select the most stable RG.  The method of Comparative Ct (\\u0394Ct) determines the most stable gene by comparison of relative expression of pairs of genes in each sample of the treatment [22]. The stable reference genes are those that remain constant \\u0394Ct values for all tested samples. For each tool, a ranking of stability was obtained.  RankAggreg package [26] was used in R software by Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate the Spearman distance and obtain the overall ranking. This package sorts from the most stable to the less stable genes, considering the stability values and the frequency that each gene is displayed according to the algorithms of stability analysis tools (SLqPCR, NormFinder, Best-Keeper and Comparative Ct).  Ct data was converted to linear values (2 -ct ) as recommended by LIVAK and SCHMITT-GEN [27]. ANOVA was performed to identify the difference among effects and their interactions (P 0.05).   Results   Efficiency and specificity of primers  To validate the reference genes used in this study, we tested primers efficiency to check their main features prior to RT-qPCR. The annealing temperature of primers ranged from 60 to 64\\u02daC and RG expression efficiency varied between 94 and 109% corresponding to a slope of -3.25 to -3.11. The coefficient of determination values (R 2 ) were greater than 0.99 (Table 3). Primers specificity was assessed by dissociation curve, which showed only one peak indicating that no primer dimer was detected, presenting excellent performance (Fig 1).   Descriptive statistics of reference genes  Ct values < 29 are strong positive reactions indicating abundance of nucleic acid in the sample, Cts of 30-37 are positive reactions indicating moderate amounts of nucleic acid, Cts of 38-40 are weak reactions indicating minimal amounts of nucleic acid [28].  Ten reference genes were analyzed by RT-qPCR. It is clear to note that there is an expression variability among the quantification cycles of the 10 genes. Based on their expression, these genes were grouped into two categories (strong, moderate). Nine genes (ACTA1, LDHA, EEF1, RPL5, UBC, HPRT1, MRPS27, HMBS, MRPS30,) showed strong expression with Ct values ranging between 12 and 29 cycles, and only one gene (TFRC) presented moderate expression, ranging from 25 to 35 cycles. Bestkeeper was used to obtain the range of variation coefficient. The lowest value was observed for MRPS27 gene (CV = 3.2%) and the highest for ACTA1 (CV = 7.8%), as showed on Table 4.   Stability analysis of reference genes expression  Aiming to cover all factors on stability analysis, data were divided into 4 groups of analysis: General group (not considering differences between genetic groups, environment and sex), Genetic group (considering the backyard breeds and commercial line), Environment (acute heat stress and thermal comfort) and Sex (male and female).  SLqPCR. According to this tool, the best reference genes for each treatment were: General,  Table 6.  BestKeeper. TFRC and ACTA1 genes obtained SD greater than 1.5 and were excluded from analysis. The most stable gene recommended by BestKeeper for each group was: General,  Table 7.  Comparative Ct (\\u0394Ct). The most stable gene pointed by Comparative Ct analysis for each group was: General, ACTA1 (SD = 0.14); Genetic group: Peloco, ACTA1 (SD = 0.16), Cobb 500 1 , MRPS27 (SD = 0.18) and Caneluda HMBS (SD = 0.14); Environment: Heat stress, ACTA1 (SD = 0.20) and Comfort, MRPS27 (SD = 0.14); Sex: male, ACTA1 (SD = 0.10) and female, MRPS27 (SD = 0.25) as observed on Table 8.   Spearman correlation between tools  In order to verify the correlation between tools, Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used by SAS 1 software. Tools were compared by the general order of reference genes. The  (Table 9).   Overall rank of reference genes  The overall ranking of the most stable RG obtained by this package is observed on Table 10. RPL5 gene expression was statistically different only between genetic groups (P = 0.0294). Nevertheless, MRPS30 and MRPS27 were not different among the studied effects. Interactions were not statistically significantly. According to these results, the normalization factor was calculated as the geometric mean of MRPS30, MRPS27 and RPL5 genes. The normalization factor was not different between breed, treatment or sex (Table 11).    Discussion  Analyses of gene expression have optimized the selection of traits of economic interest in animal breeding. RT-qPCR has been the method of choice and recommended for RG analyses in terms that it has been used by many studies in different species, tissues and treatments [11-16, 18, 27]. Recommended values of amplification efficiency were observed for all analyzed primers in this study ranging from 94 to 109%, and R 2 values above 0.99. Annealing temperature between 60 and 64\\u02daC was efficient for amplification of all genes ( Table 2). These efficiency values and temperatures differ from those proposed by NASCIMENTO et al., (2015) which used the same primers in muscle tissues from G. gallus under different treatments. This is due to different conditions in the experimental design and equipment used, highlighting the importance of performing efficiency tests for each experiment.  According to our results, MRPS27 gene was ranked as the most stable on General group, not considering Genetic group, Sex and Environment factors. In contrast to General group,   (7) 1.06 (9) 1.26 (7) 1.46 (9) 0.87 (7)  considering the other conditions (Peloco, Caneluda, Cobb 500 1 , Male, Female, Heat stress, thermal comfort), the most stable genes varied between RPL5 (Peloco), HMBS (Cobb 500 1 and Heat stress) and EEF1 (Caneluda). Besides the General group, MRPS27 gene was ranked as the most stable in terms of thermal comfort, males and females. The evaluated tools presented a good correlation between each other considering the most stable RG, except for Bestkeeper and Comparative Ct, which displayed greater discrepancy (28% of correlation), contrary to results obtained by NASCIMENTO et al., (2015). These tools use the standard deviation as stability parameter, however, Comparative Ct considers values transformed by \\u0394Ct method and Bestkeeper uses the real values of Ct [7,20,22]. The most correlated tools were SLqPCR and NormFinder (95%). A high correlation between these two tools was expected as they are the most used for analyzing the stability of reference genes, and both perform more specific calculations to determine the most stable RG.  Interestingly, for most of the tools (SLqPCR, NormFinder and Bestkeeper) ACTA1 gene was above the sixth position in the overall ranking, however, on Comparative Ct (\\u0394Ct) analysis this same gene was considered as the most stable for all analyzed factors. Comparative Ct method uses VANDESOMPELE et al., (2002) methodology, but without the same accuracy, only by comparing the expression of pairs of genes [22], which may explain the observed variation in RG ranking. Influence of heat stress in muscle tissue of chicken  As there are variations among breeds, temperatures and physiology between males and females, it is expected to occur such variations beyond statistical differences of algorithms. MRPS27 and RPL5 genes remained the most stable for all factors, however, due to the variation between experimental conditions, it is recommended to use a third RG (MRPS30) as a control for target genes normalization. MRPS27 and MRPS30 gene encodes the 28S subunit protein and are related to death associated protein 3 (DAP3), while RPL5 encodes a small protein that is a 60S subunit component and is responsible for transporting rRNA 5S to the nucleolus [29].  Results presented in this study point to different RG than those observed by NASCI-MENTO et al. (2015), which indicated HMBS and HPRT1 genes, among the same pairs of primer, as the most stable to be used as normalizers for gene expression studies in chickens. However, in agreement to NASCIMENTO et al. (2015), our results showed that TFRC gene remains the worst among all tested genes for all categories, except for Cobb 500 1 animals and heat stress environment, and thus not recommended as normalizer. These different results are due the difference between environments and genetic groups, reinforcing the importance of stability analysis study before any experiment aiming to analyze the expression of target genes for certain treatment. Influence of heat stress in muscle tissue of chicken  The importance in choosing ideal reference genes is reflected in the normalization of the expression of interest genes. Furthermore, the use of a non-stable reference gene may negatively affect the results of Fold-Change on the \\u0394\\u0394CT calculation [27], leading to a misinterpretation of the results. The three reference genes most stable in this study are suitable to normalize gene expression data from different genetic groups of chicken that exhibited divergent behavior, as induced by heat stress. Therefore, these genes must be calculated as a normalization factor as the geometrical mean of selected RG and may be applicable for data normalization in a wide range of gene expression studies using different chicken breeds and environmental factors.  Many RT-qPCR studies have tried to validate reference genes in different species and treatments in livestock, including cattle [11], pigs [12], ovine [13], goats [14], horse [15], birds [10,18,30,31] and fish [16,17], as well as in plants [32,33]. To date, no other study analyzing reference genes under these experimental conditions (environments of heat stress and comfort, different genetic groups and sex) in chickens are known. These results may be used to guide future studies under similar experimental conditions in G. gallus. Gene expression is the most basic level in which the genotype of an organism leads to phenotype. Furthermore, genes of interest may have a specific pattern of expression under certain experimental condition, giving a wide range of possibilities for functional studies that will allow the identification of suitable reference genes for gene expression normalization.   Conclusion  Our results indicate RG according to genetic group (Peloco, Caneluda and Cobb 500 1 ), sex and environment (heat stress and comfort) effects. For genetic group effect, the recommended RG for Peloco are RPL5, MRPS30 and MRPS27; for Cobb 500 1 are HMBS, RPL5 and MRPS27; for Caneluda are EEF1, HMBS and HPRT1. For environment effect, the recommended genes are HMBS, HPRT1 and LDHA for thermal comfort; MRPS27, RPL5 and MRPS30 for heat stress. For sex effect, there was no difference among the most stable genes between males and females, and the recommended genes for both are MRPS27, MRPS30 and RPL5.  The MRPS27, RPL5 and MRPS30 genes remained stable among all analyzed factors and may be recommended for normalization of gene expression data in RT-qPCR studies of breast muscle tissue of chickens from different genetic groups and sex under heat stress conditions. These three genes must be used as a normalization factor calculated by geometric mean to be used in the normalization of target genes.

Contrary to other living things, humans take their environments under control with technologies they develop (\\u00c7epel, 2008).Hence, in order to meet their gradually increasing requirements, they continue to affect E-mail: sgulec@uludag.edu.tr.Tel: (+90) 532 5114220.  Authors agree that this article remain permanently open access under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 International License natural life negatively and use up natural resources rapidly and unconsciously.Rapid population growth, too, gives acceleration to this destruction (Erentay and Erdo\\u011fan, 2009).Together with industrialization, many countries accepted nature as an endless resource but it was too late when they realized that it would be destroyed forever and never come back to its previous state (Nazl\\u0131o\\u011flu, 1993).  However, having faced with some heavy environmental problems, our country became aware of the importance of this issue, though it was late.Then, it added the topic of environment to the new education programs accepted in 2004 with the aim of training environmentally-sensitive citizens.In the 4 th Environment Council held by the Ministry of Environment in Izmir in 2000, it was emphasized that environmental education given in our country was insufficient.That is why, with the aim of having preschool children acquire a love of nature and develop positive attitudes and behaviors towards environment, environment-themed topics were included in the programs starting from this educational stage within the framework of the cooperation with the Ministry of National Education.In this way, by using technology and practicing such matters as love of nature, children were to acquire an ecological viewpoint and the logic of ecosystem starting from the primary education age in all the formal education levels (Environment and Human, 2001).  The awareness of nature to be made to acquire in the childhood period is closely related to the nature education to be given in the socialization process.In this direction, when the actual state is looked in, it is observed that the concepts of nature education and environmental education or those of \\\"nature\\\" and \\\"environment\\\" are used interchangeably.This was also seen in the examination of the dissertations written on the subject matter (\\u00d6zg\\u00fcner et al., 2007).  Environmental awareness develops with mutual interaction of various factors parallel to personality development.In the development of environmental sensitivity, the family, educational institutions, mass communication means and non-governmental organizations have important roles.Environmental sensitivity, in other words, environmental awareness, includes a dynamic structure which can develop throughout life.That is to say, it is not a structure which is formed in a period of our life and does not change at all later, but a structure which is shaped, developed and sometimes might be regressed by effects coming both from the person itself and from around the environment.In the formation of this structure, as it is with many other features, the foundation formed in the childhood years is extremely important (T\\u00fcrk\\u00fcm, 1998).  It is a known fact that educational activities are important in the approaches to permanent solutions of environmental problems.Raising individuals who are conscious of environmental problems and sensitive to the environment appears as the most effective way of solving these problems.It is necessary to inform individuals about the subject of environment and achieve behavior modification by having them acquire positive attitudes.In this context, the importance of education to be given in the solution and prevention of environmental problems is to be considered.The success in this matter is possible through the formation of positive attitudes and behaviors in the society.Undoubtedly, individuals having a negative attitude towards the environment will be indifferent to environmental problems and even continue to create problems to the environment (Uzun and Sa\\u011flam, 2006).  Attitude is a mental, emotional and behavioral reaction predisposition which individuals organize based on their experiences, knowledge, emotions and motivations towards themselves or any object, social matter or event around them (\\u0130nceo\\u011flu, 2010).Environmental education has an indisputable importance in the analysis of the environment, perception of the integrity of nature and the planet, and the acquisition of environmental sensitivity and awareness.The foundation of the environmental education is for protecting the nature and natural resources.Environmental education should not only give information but also affect human behavior.In order to achieve positive and permanent behavior modifications in individuals and have them actively participate in the solutions of problems is the basic goal of the environmental education (\\u015eim\\u015fekli, 2004).  Since education is an important tool in changing attitudes, teachers' knowing their students' attitudes towards their lessons and how to measure them can be an important factor in increasing the quality of education.And this makes it inevitable to measure and evaluate these attitudes and make studies on them (\\u00d6zgen et al., 2007).  In a study carried out with the aim of determining the effects the environmental education program carried out based on the nature experience on the primary school students' perceptions about and behaviors towards their environment, \\u00d6zdemir (2010) determined that the participant students' awareness levels related to the environmental values and the fact that they were spoilt, their concrete worries about and reactions towards the environmental problems which they were faced with and also responsible behavior tendencies towards the environment increased.Environmental education is generally examined under three headings:  1. Education given in the natural environment: It is the education by which children learn by personally interacting with nature and acquire information by doing and experiencing.Children are made to develop more positive attitudes towards their environments by personally interacting with their natural environments (playing in the mud, feeding birds, etc.).   Education about the environment:  It is the education by which children acquire information about how natural events occur.It is the educational process in which they acquire information about such matters as how rain takes place, how plants grow.   Education for the environment:  It is the education in which information is given in relation to the protection of the environment and the precautions against the upset natural balance (Kesicio\\u011flu and Alisinano\\u011flu, 2009).  Low information and awareness level which individuals have in relation to environmental problems is an important cause of these negative attitudes and behaviors leading to these problems.Of course, identification and elimination of environmental problems is possible only through recognition of them.For it is unlikely to expect individuals not being aware of the problems to be sensitive to these problems, and asking them to modify their behaviors result to them having more problems.From this viewpoint, it is considered that determining and increasing awareness levels of individuals in relation to the environment and environmental problems is one of the preconditions of coping with environmental problems (G\\u00fcven and Aydo\\u011fdu, 2012).  Education for the environment is an education aiming to modify individuals' environmental ethics, environmental awareness, environmental knowledge, environmental attitudes and behaviors in a positive way.For this reason, modification of environmental attitudes and knowledge is included among the primary objectives of this education (Atasoy and Ert\\u00fcrk, 2008).At this point, behaviors and thoughts of teachers and preservice teachers about the environment are important.Examination of preservice teachers' attitudes towards the environment in terms of various variables is the aim of this study.  In order to make individuals become knowledgeable and conscious of environment and acquire positive attitudes towards it, environment education has an important place.Student teachers' attitudes towards the environment are important in making their students acquire an environmental awareness in the future.For this purpose, answers were sought for the following questions:  1. How is the normality distribution of the participant students in relation to the environmental behavior subscale and the environmental thought sub-scale?2. How is the distribution of the findings related to the environmental behaviors of the student teachers according to gender? 3. How is the distribution of the findings related to the environmental thoughts of the student teachers according to gender? 4. How is the distribution of the findings related to the environmental thoughts of the student teachers according to branches?   METHODOLOGY  Since the study was carried out with the aim of examining student Gulec 977 teachers' attitudes towards the environment in terms of various variables, the study made use of descriptive screening.According to Karasar (2006), studies aiming to describe, explain the \\\"nature\\\" of events, objects, entities, institutions, groups and various fields are descriptive ones.Since the aim of descriptive or survey studies is to determine current situation, these kinds of studies are usually carried out in natural environments.Techniques used in descriptive studies always change names of studies.These take such names as questionnaire survey, interview survey and observation survey (Karasar, 2006).In this study, data will be obtained through the technique of questionnaire survey.   Participant  The study group was composed of 114 students enrolled in the Education Faculty of Uludag University in the spring semester of the 2014 to 2015 academic year.Of these students, 90 were female and 24 were male.52 students were from the classroom teaching department and 62 were from the social studies department.   Data collection tools  In the study, with the aim of administering to the students, the \\\"Environmental Attitude Scale\\\" was used.The attitude scale was developed by Uzun and Sa\\u011flam (2006) and consisted of a total of 27 items.Factor analysis was applied for the construct validity of the scale and the Cronbach's alpha and the Spearman-Brown splithalf reliability coefficient were calculated for the reliability of the scale.  The attitude scale was prepared two-dimensionally, namely the \\\"Environmental Thought (Opinion) Sub-Scale\\\" and the \\\"Environmental Behavior Sub-Scale\\\".The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient calculated for the Environmental Thought Sub-Scale was \\u03b1=.80 and the Spearman-Brown split-half reliability coefficient was calculated as 0.75.The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient was \\u03b1=.88 for the Environmental Behavior Sub-Scale and the Spearman-Brown split-half reliability coefficient was calculated as 0.81.In addition to this, the Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient of the general of the Environmental Attitude Scale was \\u03b1=.80 and the Spearman-Brown split-half reliability coefficient was determined as 0.76 (Uzun and Sa\\u011flam, 2006).   Data analysis  In the statistical analysis of the obtained data, the statistical package for the social science (SPSS) 20.0 program was used.To check if the data distributed normally or not, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used.It was observed that while the Environmental Behavior Scale was different, the sub-scale of the Environmental Attitude Scale showed normal distribution, the Environmental Thought Scale did not distribute normally.For this reason, with the Independent Samples T test, one of the parametric tests, was used for the Environmental Behavior sub-scale, with the Mann Whitney U Test, one of the non-parametric tests, was used for the Environmental Thought sub-scale.  The pieces of the obtained data were scored according to the 5point Likert type scale.The Environmental Behavior scale was composed of 13 items and the Environmental Thought scale was composed of 14 items.When making statistical scoring, the highest score was calculated as 5 and the lowest one was calculated as 1.According to this, the highest score to be taken from the Environmental Behavior scale was 65 and the lowest score was 13.Moreover, in the Environmental Thought scale, the highest score to be taken was 70 and the lowest score was 14.  26) differed from one another and there was skewness (2.78) and kurtosis (11.4), which indicated that the data did not distribute normally.Moreover, when the distribution graph of the sores was examined, it was observed that there was no normal distribution.   Findings related to the environmental behavior scale   Evaluation of the findings related to the environmental behavior in terms of gender of the student teachers  When Table 3 was examined, it was determined that there was not a statistically significant difference between the students' environmental behaviors in terms of gender (p>0.05).Moreover, that the female students (38.44) and the male students (38.04) score supported this result as well.   Evaluation of the Findings belonging to the Environmental Behavior in terms of Branch of the Student Teachers  When Table 4 was examined, it was observed that there was not a statistically significant difference between the students' environmental behaviors in terms of branch (p>0.05).Moreover, this means the classroom teaching students (38,80) and those of the social studies teaching students (37,98) were close to one another supported this result as well.   Evaluation of the findings belonging to the environmental thought in terms of gender of the student teachers  When Table 5 was examined, it was observed that although the score mean of the male preservice teachers (61.90) was higher than that of the female preservice teachers (56.33), there was not a statistically significant   Evaluation of the findings belonging to the environmental thought in terms of branch of the student teachers  When Table 6 was examined, no statistically significant difference was determined between the preservice teachers' score means in terms of branch.It was found that the social studies teaching preservice teachers' means (63.00) were much higher than those of the classroom teaching preservice teachers (50.94).It was also observed that this difference created a statistically significant difference between the branches towards the environmental thought (p<0.05).   DISCUSSION  When scoring the pieces of obtained data, the 5-point Likert type scale was used.The Environmental Behavior scale was composed of 13 items; the Environmental Thought scale consisted of 14 items.The items were scored from 1 to 5. According to this, the highest score to be taken from the Environmental Behavior scale was 65 and the lowest score was 13.Moreover, in the Environmental Thought scale, the highest score to be taken was 70 and the lowest score was 14.  In the category of environmental behaviors and the sub-scale of the environmental attitude scale, no statistically significant difference was found according to gender and branch.When the arithmetic means were examined in terms of gender, it was observed that the male preservice teachers had a mean of 38.04 and the female preservice teachers had a mean of 38.44.This result can be interpreted in a way that the preservice teachers exhibited a moderate level of attitude in terms of environmental behavior.When the arithmetic means were examined in terms of branch, it was observed that the classroom teaching preservice teachers had a mean of 38.80, and the social studies department preservice teachers had a mean of 37.98.This result can be interpreted in a way that the preservice teachers exhibited a moderate level of attitude in terms of environmental behavior.  Similarly, in a study carried out by Uzun and Sa\\u011flam (2007) entitled \\\"Effects of the Course of \\\"Environment and Human\\\" and Voluntary Environmental Agencies on Secondary School Students' Knowledge and Attitudes towards the Environment\\\", no significant difference was found between the secondary school students' environmental attitudes.In their study entitled \\\"Views of Elementary and Middle School Turkish Students toward Environmental Issues\\\", Y\\u0131lmaz et al. (2004) found that the elementary and middle school students' attitudes towards the environment differed in terms of gender and this difference was in favor of the female students.In their study aiming to develop a valid and reliable awareness scale in order to determine preservice teachers' awareness levels related to environmental problems and reveal science preservice teachers' awareness levels related to environmental problems, G\\u00fcven and Aydo\\u011fdu (2012) determined that the preservice teachers' awareness levels differed according to the items included in the scale and were below the required level.  In the category of environmental thought and the subscale of the environmental attitude scale, it was observed that while no statistically significant difference was found on the basis of gender, there was significant difference on the basis of branch.When the arithmetic means were examined in terms of gender, it was observed that the male preservice teachers had a mean of 61.90 and the female preservice teachers had a mean of 56.33.This result can be interpreted in a way that the preservice teachers exhibited a high level of attitude in terms of environmental thought.In their study entitled \\\"Environmental Attitudes of Young People in Turkey:  Effects of School Type and Gender\\\", Tuncer et al. (2005) found that the secondary school students' environmental attitudes differed statistically in terms of gender and this difference was in favor of the female students.When the arithmetic means were examined in terms of branch, it was observed that the classroom teaching preservice teachers had a mean of 50.94, and the social studies preservice teachers had a mean of 63.00.This result can be interpreted in a way that the preservice teachers exhibited a high level of attitude in terms of environmental thought.However, when it is interpreted statistically, it can be considered that the social studies preservice teachers were more sensitive on the basis of environmental thought.  When the preservice teachers' attitudes towards environmental behavior and environmental thought were compared, it was observed in the obtained findings that they exhibited a high level of attitude towards environmental thought but a moderate level of attitude towards environmental behavior.In their study aiming to determine the attitudes and sensitivities of the students enrolled in different academic fields of Adnan Menderes University towards environmental problems and factors affecting these, Ek et al. (2009) found that although 85.3% of the students reported that they were sensitive to environmental problems and 86.5% of them stated that they were not a member of any related associations.In the light of the data obtained in the study entitled \\\"Examination of Preservice Teachers' Attitudes towards Environment according to Various Variables\\\", the following suggestions can be made:  1.According to the research results, it can be stated that although the male preservice teachers exhibited more positive attitudes in terms of environmental thought, both genders exhibited behaviors at a moderate level in terms of environmental behavior.When these pieces of data are taken into consideration, it can be suggested that various activities to increase preservice teachers' positive attitudes towards the environment should be included in their education process.2. According to the research results, although the social studies preservice teachers were observed to exhibit more positive attitudes in terms of environmental thought, the social studies and classroom teaching preservice teachers were observed to exhibit behaviors at a moderate level in terms of environmental behavior.When these pieces of data are taken into consideration, it can be suggested that, by assuming that they are more active in the education process of young children, regulations should be made at education faculties to affect classroom teaching preservice teachers' thoughts and behaviors towards the environment in a positive way.3. When the fact that environmental pollution has reached serious dimensions in the globalized world of the 21st century is taken into consideration, thoughts and behaviors related to the environment are becoming more important.At this point, when the importance of education and the teacher in the process of education is taken into account in raising individuals who are sensitive to the environment, the number of courses aiming to increase preservice teachers' awareness levels at education faculties can be increased.

Up until now, Organophosphorus pesticides are one of the most commonly used pesticide classes in agriculture in the management of insect pests due to their high efficacy, comparatively high dissipation, and low persistence compared to other pest class pesticides (Gonz\\u00e1lez-Curbelo et al., 2012;Eco and Zweig, 2018). More often, pesticides are misused, including overdoses, adulterated formulas, and harvesting without a minimum waiting period (Herrera-Herrera et al., 2019). The extensive use of pesticides can contaminate both the atmosphere and food, leading to health problems (Sultana and Nakagoshi, 2001;Islam et al., 2009). In OPPs, extensive exposure to higher concentrations can lead to cardiovascular, nervous, respiratory, metabolic, reproductive, and even immune symptoms problems (Joshi and Sharma, 2011;Espinoza-Navarro et al., 2017). Besides, these groups of compounds are likely to change embryonic health and lead children to ADHD (Hassani et al., 2017). The toxicity of OPPs metabolites is much more toxic than the parent compound itself. Thus, OPPs are known to be the most toxic class of pesticides in insects, animals, and humans (Hassani et al., 2017). According to the USA pesticide usage database, the most frequently used OPPs are malathion, dimethoate, chlorpyrifos, acephate, naled, diazinon, methyl-parathion, dicrotophos, phorate, phosmet, and azinphos-methyl (Grube et al., 2011). In the developing world, pesticide selection is mostly older, broadspectrum, organophosphate and carbamate class, because of their acute toxicity and they are also cheaper than the newer types (Sultana and Nakagoshi, 2001 Bangladesh is a land of agriculture and many farmers cultivate vegetables in their home garden and in the field on a commercial basis (Chowdhury et al., 2011). In Bangladesh, eggplant and cauliflower are one of the healthiest, most nutritious, a widely consumed vegetable as it is available all year round and has an attractive taste (BARI, 2013;Amin et al., 2018). In Bangladesh, farmers have frequently used pesticides to ensure the quality and higher yields of vegetables (Dasgupta et al., 2007). The most alarming concern is that farmers of Bangladesh often spray hazardous pesticide like OPPs up to five to six times than the recommended dosage in one crop growing season (Sultana and Nakagoshi, 2001;Dasgupta et al., 2007). In recent years, eggplant and cauliflower cultivation have become expensive and risky for farmers and consumers due to the increased use of chemical pesticides to control pests (Srinivasan, 2008). Also, in most areas of Bangladesh, vegetables are marketed without maintaining a pre-harvest interval period. These market vegetables often contain pesticide residues due to overuse on the farm, which has adverse effects on human health (Dasgupta et al., 2007;Chowdhury et al., 2011;Nahar et al., 2020). A study found that eggplant is the most pesticide residue contained vegetable, which is the reason for the vegetable export reduction . In order to ensure consumer safety, most countries have established a maximum residue limit (MRL) and an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of pesticide residues in food items (Chowdhury et al., 2011). The impact of daily intakes of pesticide residues in food should be measured by an exposure or risk assessment.  In the present study, seven mostly used organophosphorus pesticides (acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, fenitrothion, malathion, and quinalphos) were selected to determine the level of residues in eggplant and cauliflower marketed in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. This study also aimed to assess the short-term and long long-term health risks to consumers posed by these pesticide residues.   Materials and methods   Chemicals  The standard (>99.6% pure) of acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, fenitrothion, malathion, and quinalphos were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA) via Bangladesh Scientific Pvt. Ltd. Dhaka, Bangladesh. Analytical grade methanol, acetone, HPLC grade acetonitrile, sodium chloride (NaCl), anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4 ), and Primary Secary Amine (PSA) were purchased from Bangladesh Scientific Pvt. Ltd.   Study area  The study area included five major markets of Dhaka city, the capital of Bangladesh (Figure 1). It is one of the biggest megacities with 20 million peoples and located in the central point of the country. This study was conducted by collecting eggplant and cauliflower for pesticide residues from major vegetable markets of Dhaka city. The Kawran Bazar, Mohammadpur Krishi Market, Mirpur-1 Bazar, Taltola Bazar and Jatrabari Bazar were considered for sample selection. These markets are famous for vegetables and other daily shopping in Dhaka city. These market vegetables are grown in different districts and certain parts of the neighbouring areas.   Sample collection  A total of 100 samples were collected (50 eggplants and 50 cauliflower). Ten eggplant samples and ten cauliflower samples were collected from each market (Kawran Bazar, Mohammadpur Krishi Market, Mirpur-1 Bazar, Taltola Bazar and Jatrabari Bazar) in Dhaka city. The amount of each vegetable samples was 1 kg. The samples were collected in individual polythene bags, and each bag has been appropriately labelled with the sample numbers and sources. The collected samples were transported on collection day to the Pesticide Analytical Laboratory of Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI), Gazipur. Each sample was cut into small pieces and appropriately mixed for homogeneity. Then, the chopped samples were processed at -20\\u00b0C using airtight zipper bags before the extraction and clean -up process started.   Preparation of pesticide standard solution  Pesticide standard stock solutions of acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, fenitrothion, FULL PAPER malathion, and quinalphos were prepared separately in acetone at a concentration of 1000 mg/L and stored at -20\\u00b0C until use. A mixed standard solution of 50 mg/L in acetone containing all the pesticides, as mentioned above, was prepared by adding the appropriate volume of each stock solution in a 50 mL volumetric flask and made to the volume by adding acetone. An intermediate mixed standard solution of 10 mg/L in acetone was prepared from the mixed standard solution of 50 mg/L. Then working standard solutions of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 mg/L in acetone were prepared by transferring the appropriate amount from 10 mg/L intermediate mixed standard solution into ten separate 10 mL volumetric flasks. All the standard solutions were kept in a freezer at -20\\u00b0C until use.   Extraction and clean-up  In this study, the modified QuEChERS extraction technique was used to extract and cleanup the collected vegetable samples (Prodhan et al., 2015). The chopped vegetable samples were grounded thoroughly with a blender. A representative 10 g portion of the thoroughly homogenized sample was weighted in a 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube. Then 10 mL of acetonitrile (CH 3 CN) was added into the centrifuge tube. The centrifuge tube was appropriately closed and shaken vigorously for 30 secs by using a vortex mixer. Then, 4 g of anhydrous MgSO 4 and 1 g of NaCl were added into the centrifuge tube, and it was shaken immediately by the vortex mixer for 1 min to prevent the formation of magnesium sulfate aggregates. Afterwards, the extract was centrifuged for 5 mins at 5000 rpm. An aliquot of 3 mL of the CH 3 CN layer was transferred into a 15 mL centrifuge tube containing 600 mg anhydrous MgSO 4 and 120 mg Primary Secary Amine (PSA). Then it was thoroughly mixed by vortex for 30 secs and centrifuged for 5 mins at 4000 rpm (Laboratory Centrifuges, Sigma-3K30, Germany). After centrifuge, a 1 mL supernatant was filtered by a 0.2 \\u00b5m PTFE filter, and then it was taken in a clean GC vial for further analysis.   Instrumental analysis  The concentrated extracts were subjected to analysis by GC-2010 (Shimadzu) with Flame Thermionic Detector (FTD) for the detection of OPPs. The capillary column was AT-1 (30 m \\u00d7 0.25 mm \\u00d7 0.25 \\u03bcm) was used to separate the analytes. The split mode was used for injection, and the injector and detector temperature were 250\\u00b0C and 280\\u00b0C with a split ratio: 30:0. The column temperature was programmed as follows: from 150\\u00b0C for 1 min, from 150 to 220\\u00b0C for 2 mins at 10\\u00b0C/ min. Helium was used as the carrier at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min, and as a make-up gas at a flow rate of 30 mL/ min for FTD with airflow at 145 mL/min. The flow rates of Helium and air were adjusted at 1.00 Pa, with a total run time was 10 mins.   Quality assurance procedure  The experiment was validated on parameters of specificity, linearity, determination coefficient (R2), and limit of quantification (LOQ). The specificity was determined by specific retention time on the chromatogram for specific pesticide. The linearity and determination co-efficient was calculated continuously by standard fortified solutions of each pesticide at concentration levels ranged between 0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg. The limit of quantification was calculated as the lowest detection level for each pesticide. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was used to measure the sensitivity of the method.   Health risk assessment  The acute health indices (aHI) or short-term health risk to consumer (Equation 2) was measured using the estimated short-term intake (ESTI) (Equation 1) and the acute reference dose (ARfD). The chronic health risk/ hazard quotient or long-term health risk to consumers (HQ) (Equation 4) was measured using the estimated daily intake (EDI) (Equation 3) and the acceptable daily intake (ADI). The hazard quotient (HQ) indicates a potential risk if it reaches 100%, and the higher aHI/HQ value is the higher risk. For the appropriate calculation, the ARfD and ADI values expressed as an mg/kg of daily intake for a 60 kg person for seven organophosphorus pesticides were obtained from the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) database (http://apps.who.int/pesticide-residues-jmprdatabase) (JMPR, 2004;FAO/WHO, 2019). According to FAO/WHO, the average national per capita consumption of 23 g of leafy vegetables, 89 g of nonleafy vegetables, and 14 g of fruit is an average of 126 g of fruit and vegetables per day in Bangladesh (Haque et al., 2014). The equation for calculation of ESTI, aHI, HQ, and cHI were given below:   Statistical analysis  The level of pesticide residue in collected samples was analysed and calculated in mg/kg automatically by the Shimadzu GC software. All the data analyses and calculations were made by MS Excel 2013 software.    Results and discussion   Validation of the method  In order to validate the method, recovery experiments were conducted for eggplant and cauliflower control samples. The collected control samples were cut into small pieces and stored at -20 0 C until homogenization. Homogenization was done using a fruit blender. Then, the homogenized sample (10 g) was spiked prior to the determination procedure by the addition of a mixed pesticide standard working solution to prepare the fortification levels of 0.10 mg/kg. After the addition of working standard solution in the matrix, the mixture was equilibrated by shaking and the samples were allowed to settle for 30 mins prior to extraction in order to ensure sufficient contact of the desired pesticides with the matrix. Then the samples were prepared according to the method which was described earlier. Precision in case of Repeatability (RSD r ) was determined at the fortification levels of 0.10 mg/kg. The average recoveries of the selected pesticides in eggplant ranged from 82-109% with RSD \\u22649, while in the case of cauliflower it was 80-98% with RSD \\u22648. The linearity, determination coefficient (R 2 ), and LOQ were measured in an external standard solution using the peak areas obtained by GC-FTD analysis. The linear regression equation and determination coefficient (R 2 ) values and LOQ are given in Table 1. The standard curve results showed that the linearity was excellent, with a determination coefficient of R 2 value ranges from 0.9931 -0.9998. The limits of quantification (LOQs) were 0.01 mg/kg, indicating the high sensitivity of this method. The proposed method was applied to the external standard solution for assessing its specificity. The specificity of seven selected organophosphorus pesticides was performed by comparing the retention times of each pesticide presented in a typical chromatogram obtained by GC-FTD using analysis of external added standard solution and matrix solvent (Figure 2).   Pesticide residues in eggplant  Out of fifty samples of the eggplant, six samples (12% of the total number of samples) contained chlorpyrifos residue, three samples (6% of the total number of samples) contained dimethoate residue and one sample (2% of the total number of samples) contained diazinon residue ( Table 2). All detected eggplant samples contained chlorpyrifos dimethoate and diazinon residues above the European Union maximum residue limit (EU-MRLs). In the eggplant, the most frequently detected pesticide was chlorpyrifos (12%), followed by dimethoate (6%). Among the seven OPPs, acephate, fenitrothion, malathion, and quinalphos were not detected in any eggplant samples collected from five major vegetable markets of Dhaka city. These findings are comparable to Islam et al. (2014). They collected forty-two eggplant, cauliflower, and country bean samples from the fields and markets of the Narsingdi district and were fifteen samples (over 36% of the total samples) found no OPPs . The study findings were well agreed with Hasan et al. (2017). In country bean samples collected from different Dhaka markets, they have detected two kinds of insecticides (such as dimethoate and quinalphos). Out of fifty analysed country bean samples, ten samples (20%) contained dimethoate and quinalphos residues, five of which exceeded the maximum residue limits (MRLs). Most contaminated eight samples contained dimethoate residue (Hasan et al., 2017). Ahmed et al. (2017) analysed 170 samples collected from Jessore, Comilla, Narsingdi, Tangail, Rangpur, Jamalpur, Gazipur, and Dhaka for residue analysis in eggplant, yard long bean, bitter gourd, snake gourd, pointed gourd, okra, tomato, hyacinth bean, and cabbage samples. Among the one hundred seventy samples, 21.78% were contaminated with insecticides, either single or multiple residues, in which 18.26% of samples had residues above MRL (Ahmed et al., 2017). According to Figure 3, chlorpyrifos was the most frequently detected pesticide followed by dimethoate in the eggplant samples collected from 5 major vegetable markets of Dhaka city. Out of the ten eggplant samples collected from the Jatrabari Bazar only one sample contained dimethoate residue (0.08 mg/kg). Among the ten eggplant samples collected from Mirpur-    Pesticide residues in cauliflower  Out of fifty samples of cauliflower, six samples (12% of the total number of samples) contained chlorpyrifos residue, four samples (8% of the total number of samples) contained diazinon residue and one sample (2% of the total number of samples) contained quinalphos residue (Table 3). Out of 10 contaminated samples, 9 were above the European Union maximum residue limit (EU-MRLs). In the cauliflower, the most frequently detected pesticide was chlorpyrifos (12.00%), followed by diazinon (8%). Among the seven OPPs, acephate, dimethoate, fenitrothion, and malathion were not detected in any cauliflower samples. The findings of this study can also be compared to Akter et al. (2017). They found that 22% of samples contained pesticide residues of diazinon, dimethoate, quinalphos, and chlorpyrifos residues in eggplant collected from the Mymensingh district. Among the detected OPP residues, only five samples exceeded the MRL set by the EU (Aktar et al., 2017). The present study is in good agreement with Islam et al. (2019). They found that about 12% of bitter gourd samples were contaminated with different organophosphorus pesticides (Islam et al., 2019). Figure 4 shows chlorpyrifos was the most frequently detected pesticide followed by diazinon and quinalphos in cauliflower samples. Out of ten cauliflower samples collected from the Jatrabari Bazar two contained multiples OPP residues namely chlorpyrifos (0.03 and 0.18 mg/kg) and diazinon (0.094 and 0.42 mg/kg). Among the ten eggplant samples collected from Mirpur-1 Bazar, two samples contained chlorpyrifos (0.373 and 0.42 mg/kg), and one sample contained diazinon (0.033 mg/kg). Another ten samples collected from Mohammadpur Krishi Market, two samples contained chlorpyrifos (0.525 and 0.54 mg/kg), and one sample contained multiple residues namely diazinon (0.08 mg/    Risk assessment  The mean concentrations of detected OPP pesticide residues were above their corresponding MRL levels ( Table 2 and 3). The high-level residue in the eggplant samples of some OPPs is an indicator of the recent use of chlorpyrifos and dimethoate on eggplant farms especially vegetables grown and harvested very close to the city and surrounding areas. Unfortunately, these vegetables usually get high priced because they look fresh compared to vegetables that come from distant areas. The OPPs' health risk estimated in the eggplant samples were represented in Table 4. For acute or short-term risk (aHIs) analysis, all ESTI values were much lower than JMPR's ARfD values. Besides, the highest risk came from chlorpyrifos with aHI 1.454%, followed by dimethoate with aHI 0.979%. All the aHIs were so lower than 100%, which indicates there was a negligible short-term or acute risk with the exposure to the tested pesticides via eggplant consumption.  Moreover, in the chronic or long-term risk assessment, the risk quotient (HQs) was notably higher than acute risk indexes. The (HQs) due to acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, fenitrothion, and malathion in the eggplant was 0. 025, 9.931, 0.297, 6.527, 0.148, and 0.025, respectively, suggesting that peoples in Dhaka city have no significant health risk through the consumption of eggplant since all the calculated values were less than 100%. Hence, the health risk from organophosphorus pesticide residues in cauliflower was relatively smaller and they could not pose potential toxicity to the consumer. Moreover, it should be considered that these vegetable samples were analysed directly after collection without washing. Whereas, it is a common practice in Bangladesh to wash vegetable after buying and most of them also peeled and cooked before consumption. These washing, peeling and cooking practices will definitely reduce the amount of pesticide residues to a significant level (Panhwar et al., 2014;Jankowska et al., 2016;Alen et al., 2017;Prodhan et al., 2018). Therefore, it is important to consider for policymakers not to destroy these contaminated vegetable products. These samples are not allowed for international trade as fresh products due to higher MRL value but face no problem for national consumption especially when one-third of our population is suffering from malnutrition and sufficient food intake.      Conclusion  This study found that eggplant and cauliflower contained organophosphorus pesticide residues at a considerable level in major vegetable markets of the Dhaka city of Bangladesh. Among the 21 contaminated samples, 20 were above EU-MRL where chlorpyrifos was frequently detected. However, the short-term health risk or acute health indices (aHI) of organophosphorus pesticide residues by eggplant and cauliflower consumption was negligible. The observed levels of pesticide residues in the eggplant and cauliflower do not pose a serious risk to consumers, but pesticide contamination in vegetables may give rise to concern. Therefore, a routine monitoring system must be established to control the contamination of vegetables with pesticides especially vegetables grown and harvested very close to the city and surrounding areas.

By this technique, gene quantification is obtained as the result of a gene expression of interest (target gene, TG) subtracted from the expression of a normalizer gene (reference gene, RG). Such quantitation can be very useful, but the results are highly dependent on the stability of the used RG for normalization. This procedure aims to minimize technical variations inherent to the quality and quantity of RNA introduced during the extraction procedure, reverse transcription and PCR efficiency [4]. Therefore, standardization of TG expression data is crucial to minimize technical variations that may obscure and affect the results of gene expression quantification [5].  For this technique, RG involved in basic cellular coding processes of protein such as cytoskeleton construction (actin), glycolysis (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-GAPDH), protein folding (cyclophilin), synthesis of ribosomal subunits (rRNA), electron transport and ubiquitin degradation (ubiquitin-UBC) are typically used. Also, ribosomal RNA are used, such as 18S and 28S rRNA. However, an ideal RG must have stable level of expression under various experimental conditions at different stages of development, tissue type and stimuli from external environment (e.g. heat and thermal stress, immunological challenge, among others) [6].  The stability of RG can be analyzed by software that use statistical tools, such as those implemented in geNorm [7], NormFinder [8] e Bestkeeper [9] programs. These programs allow analyzing expression data obtained by RT-qPCR technique and aim to assess the stability of these genes indicating the most appropriate. Normalization procedure requires suitable amplification efficiencies of both reference and target genes [2], therefore, an appropriate choice of RG are essential. Furthermore, the use of a single RG has not been recommended, in terms that it may lead to a poor standardization [7]. According to these authors, multiple RG should be used for proper gene expression quantification. Recently, the use of multiple RG has been used and recommended as a suitable approach for TG normalization in chicken [10].  Several studies have indicated suitable RG in cattle [11], pigs [12], ovine [13], goats [14], horse [15] and fish [16,17]. Also, studies have been carried out to identify suitable RG in chickens (Gallus gallus) [10,18]. However, to date, there are no studies reported that have evaluated suitable RG as normalizer under similar conditions as proposed in this study (genetic group, sex and environment).  Considering the above, we aimed to identify stable reference genes for normalization of target genes in muscle tissue from three genetically divergent groups of chicken (Peloco, Caneluda and Cobb 500 1 ) considering the influence of environment (heat stress and comfort) and sex.    Material and methods   Ethical approval   Animals  In this study, we used 36 males and females birds, being 12 chicks of each breed (Peloco and Caneluda, backyard breeds, and Cobb 500 1 , commercial line). Commercial animals were purchased a week after the birth of backyard birds in the Universidade Estadual do Sudoeste da Bahia (UESB), Itapetinga Campus, and raised under the same environmental conditions from November 2 to December 2 of 2015 with an average temperature of 26.5\\u02daC. The predominant climate of Itapetinga region is the semi-arid, in which the temperature increases during the day and decrease during the night. Nutritional diets followed the requirements of the Brazilian Tables for Poultry and Swine [19] and the feed was produced in the poultry sector of UESB (Table 1). All birds were raised in semi-open stalls and lined with wood shavings (wood chips).   Heat stress  Heat stress was provided in two stages so that all birds had the same slaughter age (30 days). First, six birds of Peloco breed and six birds of Caneluda breed were subjected to heat stress under an average temperature of 39.5\\u02daC and environmental relative humidity of 60% for one hour. In the second stage, six birds of Cobb 500 1 line were subjected to heat stress with the same conditions of temperature and humidity for 30 minutes. During the heat stress period, animals had ad libitum access to food and water.  During the heat stress, birds were constantly observed for behavioral changes, in order to avoid deaths caused by excessive temperature. The acute heat stress was determined at the moment that most of the birds (\\u00b190%) were prostrate (lying with the abdominal faced down), and with increased respiratory rate. All birds were slaughtered by cervical dislocation after heat stress period.  All control birds (six birds of each genetic group) were slaughtered by cervical dislocation at the second stage of the experiment at 4 am (local time) to ensure thermal comfort temperature (23\\u02daC).   Tissue sampling  After slaughter, muscle tissue samples were collected from the breast (Pectoralis major), placed in cryogenic tubes, identified and stored in liquid nitrogen. Samples were transported to the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory of the Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz (UESC), separated and stored in Ultrafreezer (-80\\u02daC).    Reference genes selection and RT-qPCR optimization  Sequences of ten reference genes were selected from literature [18] and used for analysis of expression stability using RT-qPCR (Table 2). To obtain the standard curve, we used a cDNA pool of all treatments aiming to optimize and calculate the PCR efficiency. We used three cDNA concentrations (15,45 and 135ng/\\u03bcl) and three primer concentrations (200, 400, 800 mM). RT-qPCR reaction conditions were set with initial denaturation temperature at 95\\u02daC for two minutes, and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\\u02daC for 15 seconds. The extension temperature was individually standardized for each pair of primer for 60 seconds. At the end of amplification reaction, we included an additional step with gradual temperature increasing from 60 to 95\\u02daC for dissociation curve analysis. Amplification of all genes was performed in duplicate in a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Results were obtained by using the Sequence Detection Systems software (V. 2.0.6) (Applied Biosystems Foster City, CA, USA) that generated the cycle threshold (Ct) parameter. The Ct values of duplicates were obtained directly from the above program and used to calculate the average Ct and standard deviation. PCR amplification efficiency was calculated for each reference gene using the following formula: E = (10^( -1/slope)-1 ) x 100 [20]. After efficiency analysis, the most appropriate annealing temperature and primer concentration were used in PCR reactions.   Real time quantitative PCR  The RT-qPCR reaction was performed using SYBR Green detection kit with GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, EUA), using specific primers. Gene amplification was performed in duplicate using the Real Time PCR 7500 Fast system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, EUA) and the results obtained with the Sequence Detection Systems program (V.  2.0.6) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, EUA) that generated the cycle threshold (Ct) parameters.  The Ct values were exported to Microsoft Excel to calculate the Ct mean, standard deviation and the standard curve for each gene. A negative control (ultra-pure water) also was added in each assay. The qPCR reaction conditions were defined as follow: Initial denaturation at 95\\u02daC during ten minutes and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\\u02daC for 15 seconds. The extension temperature between 60 and 64\\u02daC during one minute was ideal for all primers. Ct values of control wells were excluded from subsequent analyzes as well as the undetectable values.   Determination of expression stability of reference genes  The average Ct values of reference genes were used to set the input files according to each software. To calculate the stability of reference genes, four different analysis methods were used: SLqPCR [21], NormFinder [8], Comparative Ct (\\u0394Ct) [22], and BestKeeper [9]. All analyzes were performed in the statistical environment R [23], except Bestkeeper, which was analyzed in Microsoft Excel. Analyses were performed according to authors' recommendations of each tool.  The SLqPCR is a statistical analysis package for R software [23] using the method of VAN-DESOMPELE et al. (2002). To perform the stability analysis, it is necessary to transform Ct values in relative values (Q). This method automatically calculates a measure (M) of expression stability for each control gene in a given group of samples. The lower the M value, more stable, and thus recommending a pair of RG as normalizer.  The NormFinder was used as an algorithm for R statistical environment developed by Andersen et al., (2004) and provides information on intra and inter-group variability indicating the best endogenous control [8]. This algorithm indicates the expression of the most stable Table 2. Description of Gallus gallus reference genes, their specific primers used in RT-qPCR analysis and parameters derived from RT-qPCR analysis. All primers were designed by NASCIMENTO et al., (2015). gene by the lower mean values of stability (S), identifying the reference genes according to their groups of inter and intra-expression variation, obtaining a single gene with a stable expression.   GENE GENE ID SEQUENCE (5'-3') DESCRIPTION LENGTH (PB)   ACTA1  BestKeeper analyzes the variability of reference genes expression through the Ct calculation [24]. It uses a comparative Ct that calculates gene expression changes based on relative difference between an experimental sample and normalizer [25]. Data interpretation is based on standard deviation [\\u00b1CP] that should be less than 1, on standard deviation [\\u00b1 X-Fold] being less than 2 and coefficient of correlation [r], which should be as large as possible [9]. The correlation coefficient (r) and standard deviation (SD) are the main parameters to evaluate the expression of reference genes and must be large and low, respectively [9]. Furthermore, authors suggest excluding genes that have SD above 1.5. They do not indicate the importance of each measurement, leaving to researcher's criteria the decision to choose which parameter will be used. Based on these previous studies, it was decided to use only the SD to select the most stable RG.  The method of Comparative Ct (\\u0394Ct) determines the most stable gene by comparison of relative expression of pairs of genes in each sample of the treatment [22]. The stable reference genes are those that remain constant \\u0394Ct values for all tested samples. For each tool, a ranking of stability was obtained.  RankAggreg package [26] was used in R software by Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate the Spearman distance and obtain the overall ranking. This package sorts from the most stable to the less stable genes, considering the stability values and the frequency that each gene is displayed according to the algorithms of stability analysis tools (SLqPCR, NormFinder, Best-Keeper and Comparative Ct).  Ct data was converted to linear values (2 -ct ) as recommended by LIVAK and SCHMITT-GEN [27]. ANOVA was performed to identify the difference among effects and their interactions (P 0.05).   Results   Efficiency and specificity of primers  To validate the reference genes used in this study, we tested primers efficiency to check their main features prior to RT-qPCR. The annealing temperature of primers ranged from 60 to 64\\u02daC and RG expression efficiency varied between 94 and 109% corresponding to a slope of -3.25 to -3.11. The coefficient of determination values (R 2 ) were greater than 0.99 (Table 3). Primers specificity was assessed by dissociation curve, which showed only one peak indicating that no primer dimer was detected, presenting excellent performance (Fig 1).   Descriptive statistics of reference genes  Ct values < 29 are strong positive reactions indicating abundance of nucleic acid in the sample, Cts of 30-37 are positive reactions indicating moderate amounts of nucleic acid, Cts of 38-40 are weak reactions indicating minimal amounts of nucleic acid [28].  Ten reference genes were analyzed by RT-qPCR. It is clear to note that there is an expression variability among the quantification cycles of the 10 genes. Based on their expression, these genes were grouped into two categories (strong, moderate). Nine genes (ACTA1, LDHA, EEF1, RPL5, UBC, HPRT1, MRPS27, HMBS, MRPS30,) showed strong expression with Ct values ranging between 12 and 29 cycles, and only one gene (TFRC) presented moderate expression, ranging from 25 to 35 cycles. Bestkeeper was used to obtain the range of variation coefficient. The lowest value was observed for MRPS27 gene (CV = 3.2%) and the highest for ACTA1 (CV = 7.8%), as showed on Table 4.   Stability analysis of reference genes expression  Aiming to cover all factors on stability analysis, data were divided into 4 groups of analysis: General group (not considering differences between genetic groups, environment and sex), Genetic group (considering the backyard breeds and commercial line), Environment (acute heat stress and thermal comfort) and Sex (male and female).  SLqPCR. According to this tool, the best reference genes for each treatment were: General,  Table 6.  BestKeeper. TFRC and ACTA1 genes obtained SD greater than 1.5 and were excluded from analysis. The most stable gene recommended by BestKeeper for each group was: General,  Table 7.  Comparative Ct (\\u0394Ct). The most stable gene pointed by Comparative Ct analysis for each group was: General, ACTA1 (SD = 0.14); Genetic group: Peloco, ACTA1 (SD = 0.16), Cobb 500 1 , MRPS27 (SD = 0.18) and Caneluda HMBS (SD = 0.14); Environment: Heat stress, ACTA1 (SD = 0.20) and Comfort, MRPS27 (SD = 0.14); Sex: male, ACTA1 (SD = 0.10) and female, MRPS27 (SD = 0.25) as observed on Table 8.   Spearman correlation between tools  In order to verify the correlation between tools, Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used by SAS 1 software. Tools were compared by the general order of reference genes. The  (Table 9).   Overall rank of reference genes  The overall ranking of the most stable RG obtained by this package is observed on Table 10. RPL5 gene expression was statistically different only between genetic groups (P = 0.0294). Nevertheless, MRPS30 and MRPS27 were not different among the studied effects. Interactions were not statistically significantly. According to these results, the normalization factor was calculated as the geometric mean of MRPS30, MRPS27 and RPL5 genes. The normalization factor was not different between breed, treatment or sex (Table 11).    Discussion  Analyses of gene expression have optimized the selection of traits of economic interest in animal breeding. RT-qPCR has been the method of choice and recommended for RG analyses in terms that it has been used by many studies in different species, tissues and treatments [11-16, 18, 27]. Recommended values of amplification efficiency were observed for all analyzed primers in this study ranging from 94 to 109%, and R 2 values above 0.99. Annealing temperature between 60 and 64\\u02daC was efficient for amplification of all genes ( Table 2). These efficiency values and temperatures differ from those proposed by NASCIMENTO et al., (2015) which used the same primers in muscle tissues from G. gallus under different treatments. This is due to different conditions in the experimental design and equipment used, highlighting the importance of performing efficiency tests for each experiment.  According to our results, MRPS27 gene was ranked as the most stable on General group, not considering Genetic group, Sex and Environment factors. In contrast to General group,   (7) 1.06 (9) 1.26 (7) 1.46 (9) 0.87 (7)  considering the other conditions (Peloco, Caneluda, Cobb 500 1 , Male, Female, Heat stress, thermal comfort), the most stable genes varied between RPL5 (Peloco), HMBS (Cobb 500 1 and Heat stress) and EEF1 (Caneluda). Besides the General group, MRPS27 gene was ranked as the most stable in terms of thermal comfort, males and females. The evaluated tools presented a good correlation between each other considering the most stable RG, except for Bestkeeper and Comparative Ct, which displayed greater discrepancy (28% of correlation), contrary to results obtained by NASCIMENTO et al., (2015). These tools use the standard deviation as stability parameter, however, Comparative Ct considers values transformed by \\u0394Ct method and Bestkeeper uses the real values of Ct [7,20,22]. The most correlated tools were SLqPCR and NormFinder (95%). A high correlation between these two tools was expected as they are the most used for analyzing the stability of reference genes, and both perform more specific calculations to determine the most stable RG.  Interestingly, for most of the tools (SLqPCR, NormFinder and Bestkeeper) ACTA1 gene was above the sixth position in the overall ranking, however, on Comparative Ct (\\u0394Ct) analysis this same gene was considered as the most stable for all analyzed factors. Comparative Ct method uses VANDESOMPELE et al., (2002) methodology, but without the same accuracy, only by comparing the expression of pairs of genes [22], which may explain the observed variation in RG ranking. Influence of heat stress in muscle tissue of chicken  As there are variations among breeds, temperatures and physiology between males and females, it is expected to occur such variations beyond statistical differences of algorithms. MRPS27 and RPL5 genes remained the most stable for all factors, however, due to the variation between experimental conditions, it is recommended to use a third RG (MRPS30) as a control for target genes normalization. MRPS27 and MRPS30 gene encodes the 28S subunit protein and are related to death associated protein 3 (DAP3), while RPL5 encodes a small protein that is a 60S subunit component and is responsible for transporting rRNA 5S to the nucleolus [29].  Results presented in this study point to different RG than those observed by NASCI-MENTO et al. (2015), which indicated HMBS and HPRT1 genes, among the same pairs of primer, as the most stable to be used as normalizers for gene expression studies in chickens. However, in agreement to NASCIMENTO et al. (2015), our results showed that TFRC gene remains the worst among all tested genes for all categories, except for Cobb 500 1 animals and heat stress environment, and thus not recommended as normalizer. These different results are due the difference between environments and genetic groups, reinforcing the importance of stability analysis study before any experiment aiming to analyze the expression of target genes for certain treatment. Influence of heat stress in muscle tissue of chicken  The importance in choosing ideal reference genes is reflected in the normalization of the expression of interest genes. Furthermore, the use of a non-stable reference gene may negatively affect the results of Fold-Change on the \\u0394\\u0394CT calculation [27], leading to a misinterpretation of the results. The three reference genes most stable in this study are suitable to normalize gene expression data from different genetic groups of chicken that exhibited divergent behavior, as induced by heat stress. Therefore, these genes must be calculated as a normalization factor as the geometrical mean of selected RG and may be applicable for data normalization in a wide range of gene expression studies using different chicken breeds and environmental factors.  Many RT-qPCR studies have tried to validate reference genes in different species and treatments in livestock, including cattle [11], pigs [12], ovine [13], goats [14], horse [15], birds [10,18,30,31] and fish [16,17], as well as in plants [32,33]. To date, no other study analyzing reference genes under these experimental conditions (environments of heat stress and comfort, different genetic groups and sex) in chickens are known. These results may be used to guide future studies under similar experimental conditions in G. gallus. Gene expression is the most basic level in which the genotype of an organism leads to phenotype. Furthermore, genes of interest may have a specific pattern of expression under certain experimental condition, giving a wide range of possibilities for functional studies that will allow the identification of suitable reference genes for gene expression normalization.   Conclusion  Our results indicate RG according to genetic group (Peloco, Caneluda and Cobb 500 1 ), sex and environment (heat stress and comfort) effects. For genetic group effect, the recommended RG for Peloco are RPL5, MRPS30 and MRPS27; for Cobb 500 1 are HMBS, RPL5 and MRPS27; for Caneluda are EEF1, HMBS and HPRT1. For environment effect, the recommended genes are HMBS, HPRT1 and LDHA for thermal comfort; MRPS27, RPL5 and MRPS30 for heat stress. For sex effect, there was no difference among the most stable genes between males and females, and the recommended genes for both are MRPS27, MRPS30 and RPL5.  The MRPS27, RPL5 and MRPS30 genes remained stable among all analyzed factors and may be recommended for normalization of gene expression data in RT-qPCR studies of breast muscle tissue of chickens from different genetic groups and sex under heat stress conditions. These three genes must be used as a normalization factor calculated by geometric mean to be used in the normalization of target genes.

Contrary to other living things, humans take their environments under control with technologies they develop (\\u00c7epel, 2008).Hence, in order to meet their gradually increasing requirements, they continue to affect E-mail: sgulec@uludag.edu.tr.Tel: (+90) 532 5114220.  Authors agree that this article remain permanently open access under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 International License natural life negatively and use up natural resources rapidly and unconsciously.Rapid population growth, too, gives acceleration to this destruction (Erentay and Erdo\\u011fan, 2009).Together with industrialization, many countries accepted nature as an endless resource but it was too late when they realized that it would be destroyed forever and never come back to its previous state (Nazl\\u0131o\\u011flu, 1993).  However, having faced with some heavy environmental problems, our country became aware of the importance of this issue, though it was late.Then, it added the topic of environment to the new education programs accepted in 2004 with the aim of training environmentally-sensitive citizens.In the 4 th Environment Council held by the Ministry of Environment in Izmir in 2000, it was emphasized that environmental education given in our country was insufficient.That is why, with the aim of having preschool children acquire a love of nature and develop positive attitudes and behaviors towards environment, environment-themed topics were included in the programs starting from this educational stage within the framework of the cooperation with the Ministry of National Education.In this way, by using technology and practicing such matters as love of nature, children were to acquire an ecological viewpoint and the logic of ecosystem starting from the primary education age in all the formal education levels (Environment and Human, 2001).  The awareness of nature to be made to acquire in the childhood period is closely related to the nature education to be given in the socialization process.In this direction, when the actual state is looked in, it is observed that the concepts of nature education and environmental education or those of \\\"nature\\\" and \\\"environment\\\" are used interchangeably.This was also seen in the examination of the dissertations written on the subject matter (\\u00d6zg\\u00fcner et al., 2007).  Environmental awareness develops with mutual interaction of various factors parallel to personality development.In the development of environmental sensitivity, the family, educational institutions, mass communication means and non-governmental organizations have important roles.Environmental sensitivity, in other words, environmental awareness, includes a dynamic structure which can develop throughout life.That is to say, it is not a structure which is formed in a period of our life and does not change at all later, but a structure which is shaped, developed and sometimes might be regressed by effects coming both from the person itself and from around the environment.In the formation of this structure, as it is with many other features, the foundation formed in the childhood years is extremely important (T\\u00fcrk\\u00fcm, 1998).  It is a known fact that educational activities are important in the approaches to permanent solutions of environmental problems.Raising individuals who are conscious of environmental problems and sensitive to the environment appears as the most effective way of solving these problems.It is necessary to inform individuals about the subject of environment and achieve behavior modification by having them acquire positive attitudes.In this context, the importance of education to be given in the solution and prevention of environmental problems is to be considered.The success in this matter is possible through the formation of positive attitudes and behaviors in the society.Undoubtedly, individuals having a negative attitude towards the environment will be indifferent to environmental problems and even continue to create problems to the environment (Uzun and Sa\\u011flam, 2006).  Attitude is a mental, emotional and behavioral reaction predisposition which individuals organize based on their experiences, knowledge, emotions and motivations towards themselves or any object, social matter or event around them (\\u0130nceo\\u011flu, 2010).Environmental education has an indisputable importance in the analysis of the environment, perception of the integrity of nature and the planet, and the acquisition of environmental sensitivity and awareness.The foundation of the environmental education is for protecting the nature and natural resources.Environmental education should not only give information but also affect human behavior.In order to achieve positive and permanent behavior modifications in individuals and have them actively participate in the solutions of problems is the basic goal of the environmental education (\\u015eim\\u015fekli, 2004).  Since education is an important tool in changing attitudes, teachers' knowing their students' attitudes towards their lessons and how to measure them can be an important factor in increasing the quality of education.And this makes it inevitable to measure and evaluate these attitudes and make studies on them (\\u00d6zgen et al., 2007).  In a study carried out with the aim of determining the effects the environmental education program carried out based on the nature experience on the primary school students' perceptions about and behaviors towards their environment, \\u00d6zdemir (2010) determined that the participant students' awareness levels related to the environmental values and the fact that they were spoilt, their concrete worries about and reactions towards the environmental problems which they were faced with and also responsible behavior tendencies towards the environment increased.Environmental education is generally examined under three headings:  1. Education given in the natural environment: It is the education by which children learn by personally interacting with nature and acquire information by doing and experiencing.Children are made to develop more positive attitudes towards their environments by personally interacting with their natural environments (playing in the mud, feeding birds, etc.).   Education about the environment:  It is the education by which children acquire information about how natural events occur.It is the educational process in which they acquire information about such matters as how rain takes place, how plants grow.   Education for the environment:  It is the education in which information is given in relation to the protection of the environment and the precautions against the upset natural balance (Kesicio\\u011flu and Alisinano\\u011flu, 2009).  Low information and awareness level which individuals have in relation to environmental problems is an important cause of these negative attitudes and behaviors leading to these problems.Of course, identification and elimination of environmental problems is possible only through recognition of them.For it is unlikely to expect individuals not being aware of the problems to be sensitive to these problems, and asking them to modify their behaviors result to them having more problems.From this viewpoint, it is considered that determining and increasing awareness levels of individuals in relation to the environment and environmental problems is one of the preconditions of coping with environmental problems (G\\u00fcven and Aydo\\u011fdu, 2012).  Education for the environment is an education aiming to modify individuals' environmental ethics, environmental awareness, environmental knowledge, environmental attitudes and behaviors in a positive way.For this reason, modification of environmental attitudes and knowledge is included among the primary objectives of this education (Atasoy and Ert\\u00fcrk, 2008).At this point, behaviors and thoughts of teachers and preservice teachers about the environment are important.Examination of preservice teachers' attitudes towards the environment in terms of various variables is the aim of this study.  In order to make individuals become knowledgeable and conscious of environment and acquire positive attitudes towards it, environment education has an important place.Student teachers' attitudes towards the environment are important in making their students acquire an environmental awareness in the future.For this purpose, answers were sought for the following questions:  1. How is the normality distribution of the participant students in relation to the environmental behavior subscale and the environmental thought sub-scale?2. How is the distribution of the findings related to the environmental behaviors of the student teachers according to gender? 3. How is the distribution of the findings related to the environmental thoughts of the student teachers according to gender? 4. How is the distribution of the findings related to the environmental thoughts of the student teachers according to branches?   METHODOLOGY  Since the study was carried out with the aim of examining student Gulec 977 teachers' attitudes towards the environment in terms of various variables, the study made use of descriptive screening.According to Karasar (2006), studies aiming to describe, explain the \\\"nature\\\" of events, objects, entities, institutions, groups and various fields are descriptive ones.Since the aim of descriptive or survey studies is to determine current situation, these kinds of studies are usually carried out in natural environments.Techniques used in descriptive studies always change names of studies.These take such names as questionnaire survey, interview survey and observation survey (Karasar, 2006).In this study, data will be obtained through the technique of questionnaire survey.   Participant  The study group was composed of 114 students enrolled in the Education Faculty of Uludag University in the spring semester of the 2014 to 2015 academic year.Of these students, 90 were female and 24 were male.52 students were from the classroom teaching department and 62 were from the social studies department.   Data collection tools  In the study, with the aim of administering to the students, the \\\"Environmental Attitude Scale\\\" was used.The attitude scale was developed by Uzun and Sa\\u011flam (2006) and consisted of a total of 27 items.Factor analysis was applied for the construct validity of the scale and the Cronbach's alpha and the Spearman-Brown splithalf reliability coefficient were calculated for the reliability of the scale.  The attitude scale was prepared two-dimensionally, namely the \\\"Environmental Thought (Opinion) Sub-Scale\\\" and the \\\"Environmental Behavior Sub-Scale\\\".The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient calculated for the Environmental Thought Sub-Scale was \\u03b1=.80 and the Spearman-Brown split-half reliability coefficient was calculated as 0.75.The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient was \\u03b1=.88 for the Environmental Behavior Sub-Scale and the Spearman-Brown split-half reliability coefficient was calculated as 0.81.In addition to this, the Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient of the general of the Environmental Attitude Scale was \\u03b1=.80 and the Spearman-Brown split-half reliability coefficient was determined as 0.76 (Uzun and Sa\\u011flam, 2006).   Data analysis  In the statistical analysis of the obtained data, the statistical package for the social science (SPSS) 20.0 program was used.To check if the data distributed normally or not, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used.It was observed that while the Environmental Behavior Scale was different, the sub-scale of the Environmental Attitude Scale showed normal distribution, the Environmental Thought Scale did not distribute normally.For this reason, with the Independent Samples T test, one of the parametric tests, was used for the Environmental Behavior sub-scale, with the Mann Whitney U Test, one of the non-parametric tests, was used for the Environmental Thought sub-scale.  The pieces of the obtained data were scored according to the 5point Likert type scale.The Environmental Behavior scale was composed of 13 items and the Environmental Thought scale was composed of 14 items.When making statistical scoring, the highest score was calculated as 5 and the lowest one was calculated as 1.According to this, the highest score to be taken from the Environmental Behavior scale was 65 and the lowest score was 13.Moreover, in the Environmental Thought scale, the highest score to be taken was 70 and the lowest score was 14.  26) differed from one another and there was skewness (2.78) and kurtosis (11.4), which indicated that the data did not distribute normally.Moreover, when the distribution graph of the sores was examined, it was observed that there was no normal distribution.   Findings related to the environmental behavior scale   Evaluation of the findings related to the environmental behavior in terms of gender of the student teachers  When Table 3 was examined, it was determined that there was not a statistically significant difference between the students' environmental behaviors in terms of gender (p>0.05).Moreover, that the female students (38.44) and the male students (38.04) score supported this result as well.   Evaluation of the Findings belonging to the Environmental Behavior in terms of Branch of the Student Teachers  When Table 4 was examined, it was observed that there was not a statistically significant difference between the students' environmental behaviors in terms of branch (p>0.05).Moreover, this means the classroom teaching students (38,80) and those of the social studies teaching students (37,98) were close to one another supported this result as well.   Evaluation of the findings belonging to the environmental thought in terms of gender of the student teachers  When Table 5 was examined, it was observed that although the score mean of the male preservice teachers (61.90) was higher than that of the female preservice teachers (56.33), there was not a statistically significant   Evaluation of the findings belonging to the environmental thought in terms of branch of the student teachers  When Table 6 was examined, no statistically significant difference was determined between the preservice teachers' score means in terms of branch.It was found that the social studies teaching preservice teachers' means (63.00) were much higher than those of the classroom teaching preservice teachers (50.94).It was also observed that this difference created a statistically significant difference between the branches towards the environmental thought (p<0.05).   DISCUSSION  When scoring the pieces of obtained data, the 5-point Likert type scale was used.The Environmental Behavior scale was composed of 13 items; the Environmental Thought scale consisted of 14 items.The items were scored from 1 to 5. According to this, the highest score to be taken from the Environmental Behavior scale was 65 and the lowest score was 13.Moreover, in the Environmental Thought scale, the highest score to be taken was 70 and the lowest score was 14.  In the category of environmental behaviors and the sub-scale of the environmental attitude scale, no statistically significant difference was found according to gender and branch.When the arithmetic means were examined in terms of gender, it was observed that the male preservice teachers had a mean of 38.04 and the female preservice teachers had a mean of 38.44.This result can be interpreted in a way that the preservice teachers exhibited a moderate level of attitude in terms of environmental behavior.When the arithmetic means were examined in terms of branch, it was observed that the classroom teaching preservice teachers had a mean of 38.80, and the social studies department preservice teachers had a mean of 37.98.This result can be interpreted in a way that the preservice teachers exhibited a moderate level of attitude in terms of environmental behavior.  Similarly, in a study carried out by Uzun and Sa\\u011flam (2007) entitled \\\"Effects of the Course of \\\"Environment and Human\\\" and Voluntary Environmental Agencies on Secondary School Students' Knowledge and Attitudes towards the Environment\\\", no significant difference was found between the secondary school students' environmental attitudes.In their study entitled \\\"Views of Elementary and Middle School Turkish Students toward Environmental Issues\\\", Y\\u0131lmaz et al. (2004) found that the elementary and middle school students' attitudes towards the environment differed in terms of gender and this difference was in favor of the female students.In their study aiming to develop a valid and reliable awareness scale in order to determine preservice teachers' awareness levels related to environmental problems and reveal science preservice teachers' awareness levels related to environmental problems, G\\u00fcven and Aydo\\u011fdu (2012) determined that the preservice teachers' awareness levels differed according to the items included in the scale and were below the required level.  In the category of environmental thought and the subscale of the environmental attitude scale, it was observed that while no statistically significant difference was found on the basis of gender, there was significant difference on the basis of branch.When the arithmetic means were examined in terms of gender, it was observed that the male preservice teachers had a mean of 61.90 and the female preservice teachers had a mean of 56.33.This result can be interpreted in a way that the preservice teachers exhibited a high level of attitude in terms of environmental thought.In their study entitled \\\"Environmental Attitudes of Young People in Turkey:  Effects of School Type and Gender\\\", Tuncer et al. (2005) found that the secondary school students' environmental attitudes differed statistically in terms of gender and this difference was in favor of the female students.When the arithmetic means were examined in terms of branch, it was observed that the classroom teaching preservice teachers had a mean of 50.94, and the social studies preservice teachers had a mean of 63.00.This result can be interpreted in a way that the preservice teachers exhibited a high level of attitude in terms of environmental thought.However, when it is interpreted statistically, it can be considered that the social studies preservice teachers were more sensitive on the basis of environmental thought.  When the preservice teachers' attitudes towards environmental behavior and environmental thought were compared, it was observed in the obtained findings that they exhibited a high level of attitude towards environmental thought but a moderate level of attitude towards environmental behavior.In their study aiming to determine the attitudes and sensitivities of the students enrolled in different academic fields of Adnan Menderes University towards environmental problems and factors affecting these, Ek et al. (2009) found that although 85.3% of the students reported that they were sensitive to environmental problems and 86.5% of them stated that they were not a member of any related associations.In the light of the data obtained in the study entitled \\\"Examination of Preservice Teachers' Attitudes towards Environment according to Various Variables\\\", the following suggestions can be made:  1.According to the research results, it can be stated that although the male preservice teachers exhibited more positive attitudes in terms of environmental thought, both genders exhibited behaviors at a moderate level in terms of environmental behavior.When these pieces of data are taken into consideration, it can be suggested that various activities to increase preservice teachers' positive attitudes towards the environment should be included in their education process.2. According to the research results, although the social studies preservice teachers were observed to exhibit more positive attitudes in terms of environmental thought, the social studies and classroom teaching preservice teachers were observed to exhibit behaviors at a moderate level in terms of environmental behavior.When these pieces of data are taken into consideration, it can be suggested that, by assuming that they are more active in the education process of young children, regulations should be made at education faculties to affect classroom teaching preservice teachers' thoughts and behaviors towards the environment in a positive way.3. When the fact that environmental pollution has reached serious dimensions in the globalized world of the 21st century is taken into consideration, thoughts and behaviors related to the environment are becoming more important.At this point, when the importance of education and the teacher in the process of education is taken into account in raising individuals who are sensitive to the environment, the number of courses aiming to increase preservice teachers' awareness levels at education faculties can be increased.

The prominent myometrial/periuterine vessels seen in patients with LIPS are indistinguishable from the findings in those with AVMs (2) . Therefore, because it is a rare diagnosis that is fundamentally histopathological (5,7) and little discussed in the radiology literature, it is likely that LIPS also accounts for a portion of the cases of overdiagnosis (4) and unconfirmed diagnosis of AVMs. Nevertheless, AVM is still rarer than in LIPS (2,6) .In summary, when there is postpartum vaginal bleeding in a patient with normal b-HCG values and a finding of uterine hypervascular focal alteration, an endometrial component (RPOC) should first be excluded. When this differentiation is not clear, and especially when anomalous dilated myometrial vessels are detected in the adjacent areas, a diagnosis of LIPS accompanied by RPOC should be considered as a possible alternative to that of AVMs. The diagnosis of AVM can be confirmed by digital angiography, or the differentiation between the two diagnoses can be made through pathological study (1,4) .\",\n          \"The composition of municipal wastewater and sewage sludge reflects the use and proliferation of elements and contaminants within society. In Sweden, official statistics show that concentrations of toxic metals in municipal sewage sludge have steadily decreased, by up to 90 %, since the 1970s, due to environmental programmes and statutory limits on metals in sludge and soil. Results from long-term field experiments show that reduced metal pollution during repeated sewage sludge application has reversed negative trends in soil biology. Despite this Swedish success story, organic waste recycling from Swedish towns and cities to arable land is still limited to only about 20 % of the total amount produced. Resistance among industries and consumers to products grown on land treated with sewage sludge may not always be scientifically grounded; however, there are rational obstacles to application of sewage sludge to land based on its inherent properties rather than its content of pollutants. We argue that application of urban organic wastes to soil is an efficient form of recycling for small municipalities, but that organic waste treatment from large cities requires other solutions. The large volumes of sewage sludge collected in towns and cities are not equitably distributed back to arable land because of the following: (i) The high water and low nutrient content in sewage sludge make long-distance transportation too expensive; and (ii) the low plant availability of nutrients in sewage sludge results in small yield increases even after many years of repeated sludge addition. Therefore, nutrient extraction from urban wastes instead of direct organic waste recycling is a possible way forward. The trend for increased combustion of urban wastes will make ash a key waste type in future. Combustion not only concentrates the nutrients in the ash but also leads to metal enrichment; hence, direct application of the ash to land is most often not possible.However, inorganic fertiliser (e.g. mono-ammonium phosphate fertiliser, MAP) can be produced from metalcontaminated sewage sludge ash in a process whereby the metals are removed. We argue that the view on organic waste recycling needs to be diversified in order to improve the urban-rural nutrient cycle, since only recycling urban organic wastes directly is not a viable option to close the urban-rural nutrient cycle. Recovery and recycling of nutrients from organic wastes are a possible solution. When organic waste recycling is complemented by nutrient extraction, some nutrient loops within society can be closed, enabling more sustainable agricultural production in future.\",\n          \"Aims and objectives: To examine the nature and use of automation in contemporary clinical information systems by reviewing studies reporting the implementation and evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in healthcare settings.Method: PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, the tables of contents of major informatics journals, and the bibliographies of articles were searched for studies reporting evaluation of AI in clinical settings from January 2021 to December 2022.We documented the clinical application areas and tasks supported, and the level of system autonomy.Reported effects on user experience, decision-making, care delivery and outcomes were summarised.Results: AI technologies are being applied in a wide variety of clinical areas.Most contemporary systems utilise deep learning, use routinely collected data, support diagnosis and triage, are assistive (requiring users to confirm or approve AI provided information or decisions), and are used by doctors in acute care settings in high-income nations.AI systems are integrated and used within existing clinical information systems including electronic medical records.There is limited support for One Health goals.Evaluation is largely based on quantitative methods measuring effects on decision-making.Conclusion: AI systems are being implemented and evaluated in many clinical areas.There remain many opportunities to understand patterns of routine use and evaluate effects on decision-making, care delivery and patient outcomes using mixed-methods.Support for One Health including integrating data about environmental factors and social determinants needs further exploration.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n

The barriers that hinder its effective functioning are identified and conditionally divided into 10 groups: political, institutional, investment-financial, infrastructural, logistical, tariff, customs, innovation, information, and environmental ones. It is proved that to eliminate these barriers it is advisable to develop a cluster model of logis-128 tics in the economic region, which means a conceptual approach that involves the creation and development of transport and logistics cluster as a mechanism for sustainable operation of the regional transport and logistics system. The cluster model includes the following blocks: a single set of logistics processes; members of the transport and logistics cluster that organize these processes; algorithm of cluster formation and functioning; organizational and economic mechanism of creation and development of transport and logistics cluster; mechanisms for forming partnerships between cluster members; achieving sustainable development of the transport and logistics cluster on the basis of stimulating the regions. Implementation of the cluster model of organizing logistics in the economic region will contribute to the synergetic (economic, social and environmental) effect.\",\n          \"Globalized food systems are a major driver of climate change, biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, and the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in society.Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are particularly sensitive to the negative effects of rapid environmental change, with many also exhibiting a heavy reliance on food imports and high burdens of nutrition-related disease, resulting in calls to (re)localize their food systems.Such a transition represents a complex challenge, with adaptation interventions in one part of the food system contingent on the success of interventions in other parts.To help address this challenge, we used group model-building techniques from the science of system dynamics to engage food system stakeholders in Caribbean and Pacific SIDS.Our aim was to understand the drivers of unhealthy and unsustainable food systems in SIDS, and the potential role that increased local food production could play in transformative adaptation.We present two causal loop diagrams (CLDs) considered helpful in designing resilienceenhancing interventions in local food systems.These CLDs represent 'dynamic hypotheses' and provide starting points that can be adapted to local contexts for identifying food system factors, understanding the interactions between them, and co-creating and implementing adaptation interventions, particularly in SIDS.The results can help guide understanding of complexity, assist in the co-creation of interventions, and reduce the risk of maladaptive consequences.\",\n          \"Effective ecological monitoring is central to the sustainability of subsistence resources of indigenous communities.For caribou, Arctic indigenous people's most important terrestrial subsistence resource, body condition is a useful measure because it integrates many ecological factors that influence caribou productivity and is recognized by biologists and hunters as meaningful.We draw on experience working with indigenous communities to develop a body condition monitoring protocol for harvested animals.Local indigenous knowledge provides a broad set of caribou health indicators and explanations of how environmental conditions may affect body condition.Scientific research on caribou body condi\\u00ac tion provides a basis to develop a simple dichotomous key that includes back fat, intestinal fat, kidney fat and marrow\\u00ac fat, as measures of body fat, which in autumn to early winter correlates with the likelihood of pregnancy.The dichotomous key was formulated on \\\"expert knowledge\\\" and validated against field estimates of body composition.We compare local indigenous knowledge indicators with hunter documented data based on the dichotomous key.The potential con\\u00ac tribution of community body condition monitoring can be realized through the continued comparative analysis of datasets.Better communication among hunters and scientists, and refinement of data collection and analysis methods are recommended.Results suggest that specific local knowledge may become generalized and integrated between regions if the dichotomous key is used as a generalized (semi-quantitative) index and complemented with other science and com\\u00ac munity-based assessments.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n

While postulated to promote a systemic inflammatory response, limited studies have demonstrated changes in serum biomarkers related to PM 2.5 exposure. We aim to examine associations between short-term PM 2.5 exposure and commonly measured biomarkers known to be affected by inflammation among patients receiving maintenance in-center hemodialysis.Methods We conducted a retrospective open cohort study from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2014. Adult hemodialysis patients were identified from the United States Renal Data System and linked at the patient level to laboratory data from a large dialysis organization. Daily ambient PM 2.5 was estimated on a 1-km grid and assigned to cohort patients based on the ZIP codes of dialysis clinics. Serum albumin, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), and serum hemoglobin were ascertained from the dialysis provider organization database. Mixed-effect models were used to assess the changes in biomarker levels associated with PM 2.5 exposure.ResultsThe final cohort included 173,697 hemodialysis patients. Overall, the daily ZIP-level ambient PM 2.5 averages were 8.4-8.5 mg/m 3 . A 10-mg/m 3 increase in same-day ambient PM 2.5 exposure was associated with higher relative risks of lower albumin (relative risk [RR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01 to 1.02) and lower hemoglobin (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.03). Associations of same-day ambient PM 2.5 exposure and higher ferritin and lower TSAT did not reach statistical significance.Conclusions Short-term PM 2.5 exposure was associated with lower serum hemoglobin and albumin among patients receiving in-center hemodialysis. These findings lend support to the role of inflammation in PM 2.5 exposure-outcome associations.\",\n          \"In a research project funded by the German Research Foundation, meteorologists, data publication experts, and computer scientists optimised the publication process of meteorological data and developed software that supports metadata review.

Uses of Digital Specimens  The digitisation of skeletons has enabled researchers to investigate ranges of motion (Chapman et al., 1999;Mallison, 2010aMallison, , 2010b)), constrain soft tissue volumes (Gunga et al., 2008;Bates et al., 2009bBates et al., , 2009d)), and explore aspects of biomechanics including locomotion and feeding (Hutchinson et al., 2005;Rybczynski et al., 2008;Gatesy et al., 2009;Sellers et al., 2009) in extinct animals, free from the limitations of handling large, heavy, and often fragile bones.By digitising complete skeletons, or even just individual limbs, constraints and forces can be applied to the digital models within the computer to produce simulations that would be impossible (or at least monumentally difficult) if relying on physical specimens alone.The use of accurate 3D digitised surfaces allows for more specific placement of muscle attachments than would be possible with more generic computer models.  It is not just skeletons and other body fossils that have been subject to an increased use of digitisation techniques.Palaeoichnology, the study of fossil traces, has seen a major renaissance in recent years, thanks in part to a wider use of methods such as laser scanning and photogrammetric documentation.This has seen digitisation techniques applied to the study of particularly inaccessible tracks either due to physical location (e.g., on a cliff face) (Bates et al., 2008a(Bates et al., , 2008b)), or because of a limited time frame in which to access the tracks (e.g., when a river bed dries up, exposing the track surface) (Bates et al., 2009c;Farlow et al., 2010).By creating digital models of tracks, particularly when those tracks are very shallow and possess subtle features, and applying false-colour based on depth for example, the morphology can be communicated far more easily than with a simple photograph or outline drawing (Bates et al., 2009c;Falkingham et al., 2009;Adams et al., 2010;Belvedere and Mietto, 2010;Belvedere et al., 2011b).The ability to digitise in the field and return the digital copies to the lab is particularly pertinent for trace fossils, where excavation is usually either difficult or undesirable.Tracks remaining in the field may be subject to what is often severe weathering and erosional processes (Bates et al., 2008b).Ensuring accurate records are kept of such sites is vital in order to preserve as much information as possible, and to record the rate at which the physical specimens are being lost (Breithaupt and Matthews, 2001;Breithaupt et al., 2001;Breithaupt et al., 2004;Matthews et al., 2005;Matthews et al., 2006;Marty, 2008;Bates et al., 2009aBates et al., , 2009c;;Adams et al., 2010;Farlow et al., 2010).Similar methods can be used to document dig sites and excavations, providing an accurate record not only of the location of fossils removed from the site throughout the duration of the excavation, but also of geospatial reference to geomorphological features or other dig sites in the surrounding area.   Techniques for Producing 3D Models  The most common method of digitising large specimens or specimens for which internal structures are unimportant (i.e., when only the external 3D morphology is desired) is currently through the use of laser scanners (Bates et al., 2010).Such scanners come in a variety of models; usually specifically suited to a particular range and object size -a desktop scanner will lack the range to scan large specimens or field sites for instance, whilst an outcrop scanner with 1-5 cm resolution would be unsuitable for small invertebrate fossils or the individual bones of a skeleton.These scanners have been prohibitively expensive in the past, but are becoming more affordable as use becomes more widespread (Bates et al., 2008b).Nevertheless, few palaeontology research groups own their own scanners, and must often acquire their use for limited periods of time either through commercial rental, or by borrowing from other departments or research groups.Once the data has been acquired with the scanner, proprietary software and/or a high level of expertise is often necessary in order to align the individual scans from each scanner location, and to clean spurious data points (Bates et al., 2008b;Mallison, 2010a).  An alternative approach to laser scanning is photogrammetry, where photographs taken with a digital camera are aligned, camera positions are calculated, and a point cloud is produced.Previous uses of photogrammetry in palaeontology have predominantly been applied to dinosaur tracks (Breithaupt and Matthews, 2001;Matthews et al., 2006;Bates et al., 2009a), and have involved the use of numerous markers within the photographs and subsequent post-processing with expensive commercial packages that can require considerable user input to select matching points and align the photographs.Unlike laser scanning, this method is expensive not due to hardware, but due to proprietary software and the required expertise.  There are obvious advantages to producing digital versions of physical specimens, but until now the means to do so have remained inaccessible to most workers, either due to cost, lack of expertise, or both.Here a photogrammetric method is presented that requires little user expertise, and can produce accurate 3D digital models based only on photographs taken with a cheap consumer camera.All software used throughout the paper is based on freely available open source software, making this methodology accessible to workers from a range of disciplines.   METHODS  In order to demonstrate the use of the open source software in generating 3D models of specimens, the technique was applied to various specimens ranging in size by several orders of magnitude (from a trilobite to a fossil tree).Specimens belong to either the Manchester Museum (MANCH), the teaching collections of the School of Earth, Atmospheric, and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester (UMTC), or the Birkenhead Gallery Museum (BIKGM).As the method remains the same regardless of specimen size or complexity, the method itself will be described in general.The models themselves are presented later, along with discussions of quality, in the results section.  The process of producing a 3D digital model from a physical specimen can be summarised as:  1. Acquisition of photographs of the specimen.  2. Production of a sparse point cloud and determination of camera locations.  3. Production of a dense point cloud based on previously calculated camera locations.  4. Post-processing.   Acquisition of Photographs of the Specimen  For each of the models produced for this paper, an Olympus E-500 8 megapixel camera was used to acquire photographs (Figure 1).The choice of camera was based solely upon availability, rather than for any technical reasons.The number of photographs required varies according to the complexity of the specimen and to the resolution required of the digital model.In order to produce a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate, any given point must be present in at least three photographs from different positions, even if those positions differ by only a small amount.For complex subjects in which some parts occlude others from many angles (e.g., a mounted skeleton), photographs taken at least every 15° are recommended (totalling at least 24 images taken around the specimen) in order to produce a complete digital model.Ideally, overlap of ~50% between images should be obtained.For less complex subjects with no occluding parts (e.g., a relatively low relief fossil track), high quality models can be produced from as little as three photographs of the specimen.The images do not need to be taken or named in any specific order.For the specimens used in this paper, the number of photographs was altered accordingly to ensure the best coverage (see results section for comparison between models produced from differing numbers of images).   Producing a Sparse Point Cloud and Determining Camera Positions  Having acquired an image set of the specimen to be digitised, the next step is to calculate camera positions and produce a sparse point cloud as a basis for the model.The point cloud was obtained using the freely available software \"Bundler\" and associated programs (available from: http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/bundler/,or see section 3b below for specific Windows version).Bundler reconstructs a scene from the images and has been previously applied to collections of photographs of tourist attractions including Notre Dame and the Great Wall of China (Snavely et al., 2006(Snavely et al., , 2007)).The \"Bundler\" software requires inputs generated by other programs, including sets of images, image features, and image matches.The matches and features are generated using additional programs packaged with Bundler, and the inclusion of a bash shell script within the package means that the entire process is automated if run on a Linux platform (or on Windows using a Linux emulator such as Cygwin).After installing the Bundler package, and editing the shell script accordingly, the user places the script and photographs together in a folder and runs the script.Good datasets of images will result in keypoint matches (reported by the script) on the order of thousands or tens of thousands of keypoints for each image (for models presented here, the Bundler script typically reported between 5,000 and 50,000 keypoints found for each image).For the examples used in this paper, this stage takes approximately 30-40 minutes on a 2 GHz dual core laptop to match the images and produce a sparse point cloud (Figure 2.1).Once the user has produced a sparse point cloud using Bundler, the data must be prepared for generation of a dense point cloud by using the Bundle2PMVS script included with the Bundler package.   3a. Producing a Dense Point Cloud  In order to generate a high density point cloud from the images, camera positions, and sparse point cloud generated by Bundler and the associated programs, multi-view stereo (MVS) software is used.Here, Clustering views for Multi-View Stereo (CMVS) and Patch-based Multi-View Stereo (PMVS v2) software was used (Furukawa et al., 2010;Furukawa and Ponce, 2010).These programs are freely available under the GNU General Public License (GPL) as source code for compilation on either Linux or Windows, for both 32-and 64-bit platforms, and can be downloaded from http://grail.cs.washington.edu/software/cmvs/and http://grail.cs.washington.edu/software/pmvsrespectively.As with Bundler, these programs can be run from within the image directory according to the instructions supplied with the downloads.CMVS is run first, to produce clusters of images and enable PMVS-2 to handle large datasets.PMVS-2 is then run on the resulting clusters to produce a dense point cloud (Figure 2.2).In order to produce dense point clouds from the 8 megapixel images for each model, 64-bit versions of the programs were required in order to utilise as much computer memory (RAM) as possible.For the examples presented here, an eight core desktop with 32 Gb of RAM and running a 64-bit operating system was used.Total time to produce a dense point cloud was on the order of 30 minutes to an hour for average datasets of ~30 photographs, but increased to almost 12 hours when datasets of over 200 photographs were used (see results below).The programs are able to utilise parallel processing and will experience considerable speed up on powerful computer hardware such as multicore workstations or computer clusters.   3b. Automating Sparse and Dense Point Cloud Production with the Osm-Bundler Package for Windows  The methods outlined above rely on installing and running the software in a Linux environment, either native or emulated (e.g., via Cygwin).This can make the software difficult to use for those unfamiliar with such a computing environment.As an alternative, the above software (Bundler and associated programs, PMVS, CMVS) can be downloaded in a single package from http:// code.google.com/p/osm-bundler/.The osm-bundler package contains pre-compiled software for Windows (32-bit and 64-bit), and python scripts to automate the process.Installation and use is outlined at the above link.The python scripts carry out the processes described above for generation of both sparse and dense point clouds.   Post Processing and Production of a 3D Mesh  The dense point cloud generated by CMVS and PMVS-2 is in the *.PLY polygon file format, which can be read by many computer-aided design (CAD) packages for visualisation and post processing.Additional *.PLY files include calculated positions of the camera for each photograph.For visualisation purposes, the free software Meshlab (http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/)was used.The resultant point cloud may include spurious points due to false keypoints found in photos, or may include points relating to the subject's surroundings that are not required.These undesired points can be easily deleted, as is the case with any other digital 3D acquisition technique such as laser scanning.  Because the method relies on photographs, rather than directly measuring XYZ position as in laser scanning, the resultant point cloud is scaleless.In order to scale the point cloud such that digital units are representative of the dimensions of the physical specimen, an object of known dimension should be included in the dataset (e.g., the placement of a scale bar beside the specimen).A 3D object of known dimensions will aid in scaling the point cloud to the correct dimensions.Once the dense point cloud has been imported into the CAD package, it can be processed and surfaced in the same way as a point cloud generated via any other technique such as laser scanning, including surfacing the point cloud in order to produce a solid, phototextured, 3D model.  A 3D mesh can be produced from the point cloud in the same way as is common for point clouds captured through laser scanning (e.g., see Bates et al., 2008b;Adams et al., 2010).Although researchers will often work with surfaced (meshed) models, this paper will not describe the process of producing a mesh in detail as the process depends heavily upon the software being used and the computational resources available.In this case, the Poisson Surface Reconstruction function was used in Meshlab to produce surfaced models (Appendices 3 and 6)   RESULTS  Using the methods described above, digital models were produced from a trilobite (Phacops latifrons, ~0.04 m in length, UMTC-9/11), a fossil trackway (Chirotherium, ~1.4 m in length, BIKGM 159), a mounted elephant skeleton (~3 m in length, MANCH -A1225), and a fossil tree root system (Stigmaria ficoides, ~6 m in diameter, MANCH -L.L.11627).These specimens cover a range of sizes and levels of surface detail (Figure 3).Table 1 summarises the number of photographs used, and the size of the resulting point clouds, and also lists appendices in which the reader can download the final point cloud as a *.PLY file, and in the case of Chirotherium and the fossil tree root system, a meshed 3D object as well.In addition to these specimens, the front of the Manchester Museum was also used to generate a 3D model.  The smallest object digitised using the methods outlined in this paper was the Trilobite, Phacops latifrons.The quality of this model was limited by the macro capabilities of the camera used, given that the lens limited how close photographs could be taken.Nevertheless, the individual axial rings measuring only 2 mm are clearly recorded in the 3D model, as are other small details such as the eyes (Figure 4, Appendix 1).  The Chirotherium trackway resulted in a high quality point cloud (Figure 5.1, Appendix 2), which recorded small tracks (~ 2 cm in length and ~2 mm in relief) among the larger Chirotherium tracks (Figure 5.3).Rain drop impressions and other small features in the rock surface are clearly visible in the 3D digital model (Figure 5.3).The Chirotherium trackway was mounted in a case behind glass.By ensuring correct lighting to minimise reflections, the glass did not appear in the final point cloud.The small section of scale bar present within the point cloud can be accurately measured to within 1 mm.The generation of a mesh (Appendix 3) blurs the boundaries between centimeter markings on the scale bar, however, making measurements more difficult after post-processing.Two point clouds were produced of the mounted Asian elephant skeleton, one using 44 photographs (Appendix 4) and a second from 207 photographs (Figure 6, Appendix 5).The larger model (207 photos) consists of over six times as many points after removal of extraneous points (background walls and 'floating' points).The quality of the model does improve with an increased number of photographs, particularly around the jaw (Figure 7) and feet, where additional close-up photographs were taken.However, this increase in quality is relatively small, given that individual bones can be observed in both point clouds, including individual phalanges in the feet.Both models have missing details from the dorsal surface of the specimen's back, though this is a consequence of the height of the mounted skeleton (and comparative height of the photographer) rather than a limitation of the method, and would equally apply to other digitisation techniques such as laser scanning.It should be noted that the relatively small increase in point cloud quality between models made from 44 and 207 photographs came at the expense of computational resources.Whilst the smaller model was produced on a standard desktop PC in ~1 hour, the larger model required over 22 Gb of RAM and took over 12 hours on an 8-core workstation.  The fossil tree root system was the largest specimen digitised using the method presented here.It was also the specimen for which the least number of photographs were taken (24, see Table 1).Given that the specimen is in a fixed position against a wall within the Manchester Museum, photographs could not be taken from a full 360°a rc.Nevertheless, the final point cloud captured the visible morphology of the tree, including complex areas in which roots intersect (Figure 8, Appendix 6).Fine detail such as surface texture is not visible in the model, as all photographs were taken from some distance to capture the whole structure.  To further illustrate the utility of the method presented here, the front of the Manchester Museum itself was also imaged, and a 3D digital model was produced (Figure 9, Appendix 7).The model was produced from 52 images, however, the presence of a major road directly in front of the building meant that photographing the building from multiple angles was made difficult.Nevertheless, the final point cloud consisted of 1,071,961 points and recorded the overall geometry of the building.   Comparison with a Digital Model Produced with a Laser Scanner  In order to demonstrate the accuracy/resolution of the photogrammetric method outlined here, models were generated of a cast bird track (CU-MWC224.4;see Falkingham et al., [2009] for previous application of a laser scan of this specimen, and Lockley et al. [2004] for original description) using both the photogrammetric method and a laser scanner.The laser scanner was a NextEngine 3D Scanner HD and was used to generate a model of the track at a resolution of 5,500 points per square inch (~852 points cm -2 ) -a resolution of approximately 0.3 mm.Note that this is not the maximum resolution of the scanner, but was used in order to provide a scan of known dimension and resolution for comparison while maintaining a reasonable file size and scan time.Scans were produced from three angles in order to avoid occlusion and then aligned in the NextEngine software.The photogrammetric model was produced from 75 photographs of the whole cast and then cropped to the same size as the area scanned.The merged laser scans produced a model consisting of 96,832 vertices, and the same area in the photogrammetric model consisted of 1,390,894 vertices.The pho-TABLE 1.

Specimen   DISCUSSION  The digitisation method presented in this paper requires only basic equipment (consumer digital camera and a personal computer) in conjunction with freely available open source software to acquire accurate and high resolution 3D digital models.These basic requirements mean that this method of producing digital models of specimens (or outcrops) is extremely cost effective compared to most laser scanning or photogrammetric options, which require expensive proprietary hardware and/or software.In addition, the inclusion of shell scripts with the software means that use requires little training or expertise on behalf of the operator once the software has been correctly set up; there is no manual alignment via point picking required by the user, unlike with laser scanning or other photogrammetric methods.The 3D digital model of the mounted elephant skeleton (Figure 7, Appendix 4-5) is of a higher resolution than the mounted skeletons digitised by laser scanning by Bates et al. (Bates et al., 2009b(Bates et al., , 2009d)), but was achieved for a fraction of the cost, and in a much shorter timescale.  The lack of complex scanning equipment makes this method of 3D digital acquisition immensely portable, requiring only a pocket-sized camera.Importantly, the software requires little in the way of specific markers or features within the photographs, meaning that 3D models can retroactively be produced of previously visited sites or specimens from collections of digital photographs (providing enough photographs were taken).  The method is also applicable within relatively short time frames.Within only a couple of hours, a specimen or site can be photographed and those images processed to produce a high quality model.In order to produce higher resolution point clouds, more computational resources are required, how- ever, the lack of necessary user interaction means that processing can be accomplished over-night for larger models, providing computational facilities such as a workstation or cluster are available.In cases where such computational resources are not available, the user may wish to make a low resolution model from a limited number of photographs (<30), then produce high resolution models of areas of interest from additional photographs, and finally merge the two point clouds (after scaling).This technique has previously been applied to laser scan recordings of large track sites, in which detailed scans are required of tracks, but low resolution models of the whole site must be used to enable handling of the data (Bates et al., 2008a(Bates et al., , 2008b)).The nature of the work requiring a digital specimen will ultimately determine the density of point cloud required and consequently the number of photographs to be taken.  As shown by the Chirotherium model, specimens behind glass are not a problem for the method presented here, providing reflections can be minimised (the use of a flash is not applicable for specimens behind glass).This is another advantage over some forms of laser scanning, which can produce severe aberrations if the laser reflects off glass.The production of digital models from subjects ranging in size from a centimetre scale trilobite to the front of the Manchester Museum building acts as evidence for the applicability of the method to palaeontological specimens of all sizes, including rock outcrops and excavation sites.The somewhat inconvenient presence of a major road made taking photographs from all angles of the Manchester museum difficult, whilst the lack of a dedicated macro lens proved to be the limiting factor for the trilobite.   Making a Good Model  As illustrated by the elephant models produced from 44 (Figure 7, Appendix 4) and 207 (Figure 6, Figure 7, Appendix 5) photographs, increasing the number of images will result in a higher resolution point cloud and consequently higher fidelity 3D digital model.However, as noted above, this increase in fidelity comes at the cost of computational resources and may push the method from the desktop into the realms of specialist workstations or computer clusters (at least with current hardware).Because the processing stage is carried out after taking the photographs, the best option is to take as many photographs as possible at the time, and then if computational resources are a limiting factor, manually select the best 30-40 for producing a digital model.  The camera used to acquire images for the models generated in this paper was an 8 megapixel digital SLR, however, additional tests showed that an 8 megapixel digital compact camera produced models of comparable quality (similar density point clouds).Images beyond ~10 megapixels will provide little benefit, while serving to substantially increase processing time.Production of denser point clouds, and the capture of more complex detail, should be achieved through more photographs taken closer to the object, rather than simply using higher resolution images.   Limitations of the Method  As is the case for other digitisation techniques such as laser scanning, difficulties arise from attempting to produce models of specimens or outcrops in complex surroundings.In cases where the background is complex in both colour and topology, and when the background appears in many photographs (for instance, when photographing a mounted skeleton in a museum), the software can produce models where a large portion of the point cloud represents extraneous and unwanted parts.While these parts of the resulting point cloud can be subsequently removed during post-processing, their inclusion does increase both processing and post-processing time.In the case of small specimens, this difficulty is easily remedied by placing the object against a plain background, for instance white or black paper.Larger specimens or outcrops will benefit from ensuring the depth of field of the photograph is focused on the specimen, as blurred backgrounds will result in fewer keypoints located away from the specimen.Tracks, or specimens mounted against a wall or floor, provide the best subjects for the method as there is no 'background' to be incorporated into the processing phase.  Unlike laser scanning, which directly measures the xyz coordinate of each point, the method presented here relies on colour differences between images to locate matching keypoints and produce points.As such, areas of solid colour will not result in points within the point cloud.Whilst this is advantageous for removing unwanted areas (as noted above), it can cause difficulties for objects such as scale bars (Figure 4, Appendix 1).However, because solid colour will only occur on flat surfaces (uneven surfaces will produce variation in colour due to lighting), no information is lost.Depending on the software used for post-processing, the user will be able to either fill the hole with additional points, or employ a meshing algorithm that produces a flat surface between the points at the edge of an area of solid colour.  Because the method is scale-less, it can be equally applied to objects of all sizes, providing one of the greatest strengths of the method.However, this lack of scale means that care must be taken to either include an object of known dimension in the images (e.g., a scale bar), or measure part of the object, so that once the 3D model is produced, it can be scaled to the correct size.Whilst models can be produced of inaccessible specimens then, measurements cannot be taken from those models, and in these cases laser scanning is advantageous.   Future Possibilities  It is hoped that the method outlined in this paper will enable all researchers from any discipline access to digitisation of specimens, free from the costs and expertise required by previous laser scanning or photogrammetric techniques.The method is potentially applicable to collections of photographs taken in the past, allowing researchers retroactive access to digital data, with the potential of producing exciting 3D models of specimens, which no longer exist.With 3D models already becoming more commonplace within palaeontology and other sciences, it will only be a small step to full 3D models being commonly distributed between researchers via the internet, much as digital images are today.Production of the highest resolution models pushes the limits of today's desktop computers, but within only a few years extremely high resolution models will be easily generated on even mid-range office PCs, either through the use of more powerful CPUs, or by the adaptation of the code to run on consumer GPUs.  The advances in computational resources are not limited to the desktop however.The increasing number of smartphones possessing a high resolution camera, 1 Ghz + processors, and gigabytes of RAM, combined with the development platforms of modern phone operating systems, means that in the immediate future we may begin to see this technology appearing in common handheld devices, and with that, palaeontologists heading into the museum or the field, recording a specimen in 3D and then emailing it to colleagues anywhere in the world, all within a matter of minutes.   CONCLUSION  This paper has detailed the process of producing accurate, high resolution, 3D digital models using photographs taken using a consumer camera and freely available open source software.Digitisation of palaeontological resources represents an exciting advance for the science, and it is hoped that the adoption of this method will greatly facilitate research, allowing workers in all areas access to technology that has previously remained prohibitively complicated and expensive.As well as enabling researchers to produce their own 3D models, the widespread adoption of 3D digitisation  FIGURE 1 . 1 FIGURE 1.

Besides the major attention of infrastructure projects and economic growth, many other aspects such as the impact should consider maintaining sustainability. Currently, the value of infrastructure projects is very immense, where not only the capital cost, but the operation, maintenance, and disposal cost also need consideration [1]. Likewise, with the immense growth of the infrastructure projects, the environment faces In 1920, Arthur Pigou proposed that the emission of CO2 should be charged to monitor the damages caused by the emission to the society and environment [28]. Later on, the proposal of considering charges for CO2 was agreed with the implementation of the carbon price by most of the nation to overcome the Global Warming Potential (GWP) [29]. To implement the idea of the carbon price, a cap-and-trade system and carbon taxes was introduced. The cap-and-trade is a general concept by a government regulatory scheme intended to regulate activities of total emissions level. In the cap-and-trade system, the state grants restricted annual permits allowing businesses to release carbon dioxide in such levelled amount. Companies are fined if they generate emissions greater than their quotas permit. Unused permit allowances may be marketed or \"trade,\" from businesses who reduce their emissions to other companies. Whereas the CO2 tax is a consumption tax on transportation and energy fuels emissions. Carbon taxes aim to decrease emissions of carbon dioxide by rising prices which aims in reducing the demand for fossil fuels [30]. Incorporating the carbon cost in the LCA assessment of infrastructure projects could be a possible solution to minimize the harmful impact. Likewise, LCA, the Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) is considered an appropriate methodology by decision-makers to evaluate the economical and socio-environmentally sustainable infrastructure project's consequences [31][32][33][34][35]. LCCA has many applications, among which it allows the decision-makers to compare and choose the best alternative to achieve sustainable development [36,37]. LCCA is utilized in the decision-making process during the planning and design stage to evaluate all the constraints related to a project [38][39][40]. To meet sustainability goals, it is necessary to evaluate all economic practices and activities over the life cycle of a project. Planning at the early stage of the infrastructure projects may be more cost-effective with a resilient and productive construction over the life cycle with less environmental impact [41][42][43][44]. In recent decades, substantial attention was paid to the application of LCCA in infrastructure projects. Whereas the practical implementation of the process is observed considerably very low. In the economies of many nations, infrastructure plays an important part. Economic development is related to the construction of infrastructure projects, that is why a huge investment has been made in this sector. Figure 2 highlights the contribution of infrastructure projects in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) through investment in various countries. In 2018, the Chinese average capital investment as a proportion of the country's GDP was 10 times higher than the US. Chinese investments were considerably higher than in all other countries. Compared to its western European counterparts, investments in central and eastern Europe were larger [45]. Globally, new infrastructure projects face delays and cost overruns, which lead to the inefficient use of public resources [46,47]. The root causes include the lack of transparency in project selection, the lack of project preparation, the silo approach by public entities in assessing feasibility studies, and the lack of public sector capacity to fully develop a bankable pipeline of projects [48,49]. To tackle these issues, the government need a smarter investment approach and to do so critical policies sustainable are required. Given financial limitations, agencies need to utilize systematic decision-making methodologies that offer insight into long-term economic viability. One such approach is the LCCA, which measures the economic risk when considering the sustainability of infrastructure projects [50,51]. However, the functional implementation of LCCA depends on a variety of factors such as the availability of supporting project documentation, the degradation insights into the state of the infrastructure, and the availability of guidance for calculating usage costs [40,52]. Over the last decade, numerous research on LCCA has been performed to determine the cost of infrastructure projects [19,[53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61]. Most of the studies have concentrated on comparing products used in rigid and compact infrastructure or have sought to reduce the cost and the environmental effect of infrastructure by utilizing advanced, bio-based, or recycled materials [19,[53][54][55][56][57]. In 1960, the American Association of State Highway and Transport Officials (AASHTO) released a detailed guide on project procedures. As per guidelines, AASHTO introduced LCC in its infrastructure Construction Guide in 1972 [62,63]. Thus, according to AASHTO, LCC comprises all expenses and advantages connected with the provision of infrastructure during their whole life span [40,64]. It covers costs due to the construction, repair, reconstruction, and disposal of the infrastructure facilities and costs related to travel time, vehicle service, injuries, and time delays during the initial development, maintenance, or rehabilitation of road users [65][66][67]. Because these costs do not appear at the execution stage, the interest rate or time value of capital has become significant, therefore, the terms net present value (NPV) and equal annual expense (EUAC) were added into the process of LCCA [68,69].  The popular approach to LCCA is the NPV [40,[70][71][72], for which the cost is discounted. The discount rate is a significant factor in LCCA as it has a clear influence on the final costs [73,74]. Discounting is a central methodology in LCCA which considers the time value of money as it is more in the present than in the future [75,76]. All costs are attributed to their NPV after discounting them to find the complete LCC for each project [77][78][79]. This approach is often utilized where the expense of the item is to be compared over a different period. Furthermore, the value of cost comparisons focusing on the operating period, as maintenance in the operation period can have a serious effect on LCC. The US Department of Defense developed a framework to introduce LCCA for defense logistics in feasibility stage to increase its cost-effectiveness in the awarding of competitive bids, whereas, LCCA has acquired significance in other industries that aim to make sustainable development decisions [80][81][82].  To achieve the sustainability goal the integration of LCA and LCCA provides an efficient decision-making evaluation system. The LCA evaluation provides data required by quantifying environmental and social assessment for a comprehensive LCCA. LCCA assessment is responsible for the agency costs, i.e., the financing department expenditures. In addition to the agency costs, it also accounts for usage costs which are the expense of the vehicles induced by the design of the infrastructure. Moreover, the environmental costs such as the costs for emissions generated by construction and operating phases can also be considered for which LCA is the core assessment approach that generates useful data for LCCA. The data generated by the process of LCA can be utilized in the process of LCCA in which the indicators of LCA could be converted into the cost parameters.  While conducting the systematic literature review, a variety of publications related to LCA and LCCA have been identified. Historical evidence has been analyzed using the Scopus database [83] suggesting that reported publications in this field of study are changing significantly. Figure 3 indicates the number of publications from 1999 to 2020. From the 1999s to the 2007s, less work was performed on the implementation of LCA and LCCA in infrastructure projects, although, after 2007, sustainability was established as a moderate research priority in infrastructure projects and gained a foothold in research to add improvement to the field after 2012. To date, the usage of LCA and LCCA in sustainability, project management, construction productivity, and cost-effectiveness in infrastructure projects is of primary importance by the researchers. Although massive research has been carried on LCA and LCCA, there is still less interest among stakeholders in its application in construction projects [84][85][86][87].  The impact of life cycle evaluation research is evident in the field of engineering, as it acts as a significant measure that allows the engineering industry to determine efficiency based on sustainability, along with the serviceability and resilience of any project. In the process of life cycle evaluation, the costs and impact from cradle-to-grave of a project are included that delivers a momentous project. Besides the importance of LCA and LCCA, the impact of its implication in the infrastructure projects seems less. Thus, the purpose of this systematic review was to examine the existing literature conducted with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement on the implementation of LCA and LCCA in infrastructure projects and to highlight the influence of it on different aspects of infrastructure projects to ensures sustainability. Besides, the integrated LCA and LCCA approach was highlighted to quantify its impact on economic, social and environmental sustainability. Moreover, a conceptual framework was developed, which integrates the LCA and LCCA considering the cost and impact along with impact assessment cost to enhance sustainable decision making. The developed framework classifies the impact of different costs associated with infrastructure projects and their impact on sustainable constrains. Thus, it will help the decision-makers to enhance sustainable with the consideration of these costs in the planning and design phases. Additionally, to evaluate the framework, a case study was performed with an integrated LCA and LCCA approach to quantify the associated costs and impact. Besides, carbon prices were incorporated in the framework. In previous studies, the carbon price was not focused, whereas in this study the carbon price is incorporated in the developed model for integrated LCA and LCCA, which will assess the practitioners to consider the impact reduction cost to deliver a sustainable project.   Methodology  The methodology of this review consists of three stages to achieve the research aim which is to examine the existing literature conducted on LCA and LCCA for infrastructure projects and to illustrate how LCA and LCCA affect different aspects of infrastructure projects and ensures sustainability during decision making. In the first stage the problem was identified, the objective was established where an overall literature review was conducted. Then a methodological approach, i.e., Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [88][89][90][91][92][93] was selected to conduct the systematic literature review. The second stage of the research is focused on the suggested PRISMA statement followed by several researchers. The motivation for selecting the PRISMA statement in this review paper is the systematic dissemination after the screening of the collected documents, which would make it simpler for researchers to carry out a thorough review. The flowchart for the PRISMA statement is shown in Figure 3. The PRISMA methodology adopted for this analysis consists of four steps. In the first step, data search policy and databases have been developed, also the keywords and search limitations have been defined. The PRISMA statement for the recognition of selection requirements has been introduced. In the second step, the data were screened and filtered by evaluating the titles and abstracts of the selected documents. In the third stage, the determination of eligibility was carried out in full text and the documents which did not fall into the scope were omitted. Data were retrieved from the selected datasets in the fourth step of PRISMA to conduct further interpretation. In the third stage, the results were identified, and a review was interpreted in the extracted publications followed by a detailed discussion. Moreover, based on the literature a framework was developed to integrate the LCA and LCCA with the incorporation of emission cost. Moreover, to evaluate the framework, a case study was conducted on a road project that justifies the impact of integrated LCA and LCCA on an infrastructure project.     Research Strategy  A technique for this systematic review was designed to collect data from different sources for the related literature depending on the nature of this research. Four databases have been selected, i.e., Web of Science, Science Direct, Emerald, and Scopus which are known to be the top databases that include all indexed publications. The scope of this study focuses on \"Life Cycle assessment\", \"Life Cycle Cost Analysis,\" and integration of both LCA and LCCA in the \"infrastructure projects\". Data was checked in these databases using the search string (((\"life cycle assessment analysis\" OR \"LCA\") AND (Life cycle cost analysis)) AND (pavement)). The corresponding keyword phrase is described based on the search algorithm of the selected databases, which contains the main keywords related to the scope of the research. Besides, the limitation for the type of publication i.e., research articles, review articles and conference papers were also applied. The scope of the research was then narrowed down to the construction industry and eventually to the infrastructure projects. Moreover, the publication in English was chosen only.   Selection Criteria  The selection parameters used for this systematic review are focused on the PRISMA statement established by Moher, et al. [94]. The primary objective was to perform a state-ofthe-art study of integrated \"Life Cycle Analysis\" and \"Life Cycle Cost Analysis\" in infrastructure projects and its role in \"sustainability\" and \"project management\" at various stages of the project. A total of 1251 publications have been identified by applying the constraint of type, area, and language.   Quality Assessment  The data obtained from the four databases have been combined into a single file getting 1251 results which were reviewed for duplication. The duplication often exists because some of the publication exists in multiple databases. In the analysis total of 99 publications were noticed as duplication and were omitted from the list and 1152 results remained for further screening. Subsequently,1152 results were reviewed by deleting publications with irrelevant titles and 243 publications were left for further screening. In the next stage, the abstracts were reviewed to include only those publications which fulfil the purpose of this review. After reviewing publications based on titles and abstracts, 129 publications were chosen for quality assessment. A full-text study of the 129 publications was completed and only 55 related publications were left and used for a thorough review and analysis.   Results and Interpretation  The overview of the number of publications over the years is outlined in this portion. Besides, a keyword review conducted with VOSviewer software is provided. Subsequently, the interpretation of the included papers, along with a philosophical framework, which indicates the impact of LCA and LCCA on the infrastructure projects was proposed. To assess the proposed framework a case study was conducted that enhance the adaptability of the framework.   Summary of extracted articles  For this systematic literature review, four databases were chosen i.e., Scopus, Web of Science (WOS), ASCE Library and Emerald. In the data assessment 44 publication from Scopus, 33 from WOS, and 4 from ASCE and Emerald each was considered for the interpretation. These databases provide information from the largest research, publishing and patent library in the world, offering access to the most reputable material. These databases frequently classify, interpret, and exchange the most significant data, uncover new developments in the research field, and identify influential collaborators. Moreover, out of 55 publications, 20 were research articles, 4 were conference papers and 2 weres review papers.   Keywords analysis  A systematic analysis of the keywords in specific fields of science helps to clarify the dynamics of development and inequalities in the research sector. By examining the keyword co-occurrence relationships, the role and purpose of internal components can be better understood in a certain academic area and the limits of the discipline can be revealed. In the current systematic analysis, with the benefit of VOSviewer software, a keyword-based data connection was created, as shown in Figure 5 for the data searched by the keywords (((\"life cycle assessment analysis\" OR \"LCA\") AND (Life cycle cost analysis)) AND (pavement)).   Figure 5. Mapping of Co-occurrence Keywords  The frequency of keywords was evaluated using the \"complete count\" methodology available in the VOSviewer. The minimum occurrence of keywords was set as 3 such that the VOSviewer can consider a keyword having an occurrence of more than 3 times. With 6 keyword occurrences, a total of 77 eligible words have been found by the program that reaches the threshold. A mapping network of 77 linked recurrent keywords with four fuzzy clusters was created. The cluster nodes are a keyword that connects to other nodes indicating the connection between them and the keywords used in these publications frequently. The first cluster of Blue nodes was assembled around the term \"life cycle assessment\" with a maximum occurrence of 61 and a term \"life cycle cost\" having occurrence 43. Inside the same cluster, the terms \"environmental impact\" and \"energy consumption\" with occurrence 12 and 7 demonstrate the assessment of the environmental impact of infrastructure projects and the associated cost were focused on by the researchers. Construction projects have a significant influence on the environment and the economy, which is often assisted by decision-making strategies such as life cycle assessment and LCCA to ensure sustainability. The second cluster of green nodes reflects the second large cluster assembled around the most used word \"sustainability\" with the occurrence of 57 and \"life cycle cost analysis\" with the occurrence of 23. This cluster comprises several primary terms such as: \"concrete,\" having 11 occurrences, \"pavement\" with 9 occurrences, \"performance\" with 7 occurrences, \"economic analysis\" with 5 occurrences and other related words. This cluster demonstrates the researchers focus on the identification of economically sustainable pavement. Optimizing the environmental effects and expense of the project may be accomplished by implementing special approaches such as recyclable materials and ensuring sustainability by decision-making tools such as LCCA, as after assessment of the sustainable socio-environmentally sustainable options the final decision only based on the available economic resources. The third cluster with red nodes was assembled around \"pavement management\" with 16 occurrences near \"life cycle assessment\" with 12 occurrences. The surrounding words within this cluster are \"asphalt pavement,9\", \"greenhouse gas emissions,9\", \"sustainable development,8\" and \"energy,8\". This cluster describes the focus of researchers in optimizing environmental indicators by adopting recycled or reclaimed material in infrastructure projects which reduces harmful emissions. Whereas the keyword analysis shows that the main concern was to optimize the consequences of an infrastructure project with management strategies. Proper management strategies enhance the project efficiency during the Operating and maintenance phases which are the most impact causing stages of a project. Infrastructure management and pavement management has a significant combination with LCA and LCCA which shows the contribution of LCA and LCCA decision-making techniques to the management of infrastructure projects. The fourth influential cluster has yellow nodes around the word \"life cycle costing\" with 8 occurrences, along with \"life cycle assessment\" and \"environmental impact\" with 7 occurrences both. LCA justifies the environmental impact and provides the required data for LCCA. In the various publication, the integrated LCA and LCCA approaches are adopted to evaluate the economic, environmental, and socially sustainable project with the inclusion of environmental and social costs. Besides, a significant term \"uncertainty analysis\" of 5 occurrences has been used since the data required for processing LCA and LCCA is expected to face data uncertainty. The term uncertainty has close connections to the term \"sensitivity analysis\" of 3 occurrences which is used to resolve uncertainty. Table 1 indicted the summary of the keywords, their occurrences and link with other keywords derived from VOSviewer.    Analysis of The Extracted Publication  In this section, the chosen publications were analysed and the results are interpreted. First, the publication targeting the LCA is stated following by the publication focusing on the LCCA in the infrastructure projects. The last publication which focuses on the integration of LCA and LCCA to achieve economic, social, and environmental sustainability are interpreted.   Assessment of Infrastructure Performance with LCA  In this section, the publication focused on the LCA were interpreted. LCA was adopted to assess the material selection and impact of materials and infrastructure at various phase of the life cycle.   Phases of LCA  The first phase in the construction process is to extract raw materials used to manufacture the product linked with GHS emissions. The second phase is the transportation of the extracted materials and machines to the building site and then transported to waste disposal from where the construction activities of the project, such as the construction of new infrastructures, maintenance, reconstruction, and renovations, progress. On the construction site, utilization of equipment may account for GHG pollution. In the maintenance and rehabilitation phase of LCA, emissions of GHGs are to be considered because of traffic delays caused by construction and maintenance. Then comes the use phase, where the fuel consumption and emission of GHG due to deteriorating pavements are calculated. In the end, life stage pavement materials demolished and then deposits or recycle, where the demolition and recycling or transporting of the demolished materials causes harmful emission. GHG emission analysis is highly important for stage and is considered by many researchers in all extraction, manufacturing, transport, production, use and end-of-life activities [12]. The construction phase has the highest (62.0 %) impact on the environment, followed by the end life phase (35.8 %) and then the M&R phase (1.7 %) [95]. This impact only considers the construction, maintenance and demolition activities, whereas the user's activities are omitted which changes the results drastically. Liu, et al. [96] considered the material production, transportation, construction and use phase of a permeable pavement compared to dense asphalt, whereas the research has some limitation that did not consider some environmental factors for a permeable pavement which needs to be focused on future. Most approaches overlook Maintenance and Rehabilitation (M&R) phase assessments, which may be very useful in maximizing the effects of the M&R phase. However, the service and performance level of infrastructure changes dynamically where the environmental impact depends on it. Batouli and Mostafavi [97] analyzed the scenario and adopted service and performance adjusted LCA (SPA-LCA) where it was concluded that the increasing demand of infrastructure leads to increase environmental impact which could be overcome with the improvement of current management practices in the use phase. Moreover, it was also suggested increasing the investment for M&R could significantly improve the network performance and sustainability. Similarly, the use phase of a project has more impact on the environment as the traffic and vehicle-related emissions covers use phase consequences [98]. In the LCA usage period, Haslett, et al. [99] observed a 6.4 % rise in energy demand and GWP when incorporation the realistic traffic conditions. whereas in some practices the impact of the usage periods is ignored while some did not mention clearly.   Pavement Materials Assessment with LCA  The material endorsement evaluation in the infrastructure project is one of the key parameters to consider for a sustainable environment. Different considerations such as cost and environmental effects should be examined in the estimation of material selection. Besides, its impact on survivability and performance on a project should be taken into consideration when making decisions on the materials. LCA is a standard approach that promotes the overall use of products for an infrastructure project. Various research undertaken LCA in the materials assessment in the infrastructure project, where some researchers focused on virgin materials, some focused on recycled while some assessed the combination of both. Although some researchers did not clarify the nature of the material. In a case study, Heidari, et al. [100] analyzed the effect of concrete and asphalt on a project and discovered that the concrete pavement would increase the cost of the projects by about 35 %, although eliminating pollution by around 2000,000 tons per year and reducing the use of energy by 700,000 GJ. Similarly, a 26 % reduction was measured for Hot Mixed Asphalt (HMA) pavement compared to the plain concrete pavement. It identifies that the smart selection of materials should be assessed with LCA to measure sustainable measures. LCA is the methodology for measuring the environmental effects of a given infrastructure project during its life cycle, from the processing of raw materials to the final recycling. The environmental effects of infrastructure projects were measured through analyses of environmentally sustainable materials and recycled materials. The relative energy, Global Warming Potential (GWP) and cost decreased with increased recycled content, as observed by Yang, et al. [21] by comparing 10 blends with 25-60 % ABR to a virgin densegraded mixture. Similarly, Araújo, et al. [23] analyzed the different type of recycled materials and With 50.0% Recycled Asphalt pavement (RAP), energy consumption was reduced by 3% and gaseous emissions were reduced by 14 % for CO2, 23% for SO2 and by 15% for CH4, N2O and NO. In many countries, the recycling of concrete paving has been a common practice. While the material properties and structural efficiency of floors substituted by recycled concrete aggregates with virgin concrete have been extensively identified. However, relatively little focus been done to determine the possible advantages of sustainability with LCA. Some of the researchers focused on the recycled materials, where the impact of recycled materials is found minimum as compared to the virgin materials such as hot mix asphalt with reclaimed asphalt (HMAP) achieve best social and economic performance compared to hot mix asphalt with an additive warm mix which achieve more environmental performance [101]. Similarly, 25 % clinker hydraulic road binders minimize GHG emissions by more than 50 % while fly ash also decreases GHG emissions with 50 % cement material [22]. The infrastructure project requires a huge number of materials as the development is growing at a high rate. Assessment of recycled material is an important alternative for sustainable construction the relative energy, GWP and cost were decreased with the increased recycled content by comparing recycled materials with virgin materials. Recycled materials such as recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) and recycled asphalt shingle(RAS), which can partly replace virgin asphalt binding and aggregate mixtures are widely identified as one of the most frequently used sustainable techniques for asphalt pavement (AC) [21]. The trend of recycled concrete is becoming very common where material performance and properties are emphasized very largely although little consideration is given to the sustainability perspective.

To maintain the quality and efficiency of the infrastructure project it should be maintained properly throughout its life. The proper functionality and safety of infrastructure require routine M&R intervention. LCCA is an approach that identifies the M&R intervention of infrastructures including direct and indirect costs. LCCA approach assists to evaluate optimal M&R approaches for deteriorating structures over a specific time. After reviewing the included articles, a detailed summary of the articles was demonstrated in Table 3 which were then interpreted.    Cost Function  Construction analysis provides a face value mostly case studies, i.e., the discussion of conscience, comprehensive illustration of the implementation of a modern model or process. The life cycle of the infrastructure project is fully case-based, where the outcomes of the trials are compared in percentage form to determine the better alternatives. In a case study of an infrastructure project, Kong and Frangopol [105] incorporated cost function with the time variable. Incorporation of time with cost function evaluate the impact of time travel or delays due to pavement performance and serviceability on the user cost. Although incorporating cost function with other variables such as the effect of project inspection and scheduled or routine M&R will improve the maintenance efficiency of infrastructure deterioration. Introducing cost function in the infrastructure intervention and reliability enhances the reliability-based structure management system. A reliability-based management model can be used for various analyses. A safe and operable approach is required to sustain the deteriorating infrastructure assets. Mostly infrastructure management possesses detailed LCCA to allocate the funds for M&R optimally. Saad and Hegazy [106] identify the lack of a mechanism to justify the allocation of LCCA details in M&R and incorporated microeconomics theories to justify the decision made based on the LCCA. The concept of marginal utility is used by economists to determine the number of items, the consumers are willing to invest. The microeconomics approach justifies the fund allocation based on consumer behaviours and proved the marginal utility per dollar is equalised.   Agency Cost and Users Cost  The LCC of infrastructure consists of Agency and User Costs over an appropriate period of analysis. The Agency's costs include the initial construction costs and the M&R costs incurred during the analysis period. User costs occur during the serviceability phase and M&R phase when the working zone is present. Normally in LCCA of traditional practice, the agency costs are considered whereas the users operating cost is ignored, which is more important for accurate calculation of LCC. Okte, et al. [120] investigated the resurfacing Illinois Tollway project to evaluate the vehicle operating cost (VOC) as user cost and found that the VOC should be considered in LCCA as it is reliable for the International Roughness Index (IRI) progression model. IRI is the strategy used in the pavement design which impacts the VOC directly. The integration of user costs into design and decisionmaking systems immediately from the planning phase of the project would enable transport departments to remain customer-oriented and minimize the total impact of the project [123].   Operation and maintenance Management Cost  For infrastructure design, cost-optimal solutions are required that not only affect the Life cycle cost but also enhance the management strategies to ensure safety performance [111]. Infrastructure or pavement design and maintenance management have considerable interaction among them such as good designed and properly maintained pavement minimize the life cycle cost of the whole project. Whereas, there is a lack of consideration of maintenance management costs noticed in the design phase thus increasing the life cycle cost of the project [112]. The M&R tasks on operation infrastructure are very important, whereas M&R activities increase the users' cost by causing traffic jams and detours. A concurrent M&R methodology has been introduced into the maintenance management of existing bridges infrastructure which helps in integrating the maintenance timing of the bridge elements hence reducing the user cost and total life cycle cost [113]. The same methodology can be adopted for on land pavements to optimize the users' cost. The model optimizes the life cycle cost of the bridge by incorporating the user cost as well as the agency cost, but the deterioration cost is not considered which needs to be incorporated further. Moreover, an economical construction strategy for bridges has been highlighted and it is evident that the bridges project management consist of investment cost as well as appropriate operating cost because of extended service life. An innovating computational model is presented, which links the pricing databases into two sets such as the operational and maintenance cost calculations are based on the expert database whereas the replacement cost of the components linked to the designer price database [114]. Mostly the M&R methods for infrastructure projects were reported for a specific type of project such as pavements, bridges, etc. Farran and Zayed [115] developed a generic model for maintenance and rehabilitation planning of public infrastructure that helps in determining the optimal M&R decision-making analysis by using the genetic algorithm and Markov chains. The model helps in overcoming the computational calculation whereas the model is only valid for four alternative decisions. Similarly, in railway infrastructure, the operational cost equates to 25-30 % per annum. The railway track needs to be inspected and maintained annually. Senaratne, et al. [119] selected Sydney Harbour Bridge (SHB) as a case study to evaluate the maintenance and ongoing operation of railway infrastructure considering timber transoms. The transoms used has shorted life span and height chances of degradation, therefore the issue was analysed by exploring sustainable alternative such as fiber composite with the implication of LCCA and found it more financially stable. Thus, the M&R during the operational phase affect the project significantly which needs to be assessed during decision making where LCCA is found considerable approach for best decision making.   Material Selection With LCCA  In complex infrastructure projects, the materials need routine maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation to ensure safety and maintaining the interconnected structure to overwhelm the corrosion associated cost. Corrosion management strategies should be the selection of suitable materials during repair or utilizing materials having corrosion-resistant properties that help to optimize the LCC. Long-term cost-effectiveness has been analysed for various groups of materials in the design and repairing phase and a time-dependent reliability LCC model has developed [107]. Moreover, Hasan, et al. [127] introduced a new method that incorporates the hazard correlated with airborne chloride with the Carbon Steel and Stainless Steel reinforcements into the probabilistic LCC estimate of the RC bridge to manage the corrosion hazards. The model asses the practitioners to assign an appropriate geographical location for the girder bridge to optimize the maintenance cost. While to improve the performance and productivity for sustainable infrastructure, usually, new materials are adopted at the project level and network level. LCCA plays a significant role in material selection [108]. Though, because of the limited implementation data of newly adopted materials, the reliable estimate of the life cycle cost becomes a challenge. A bottom up LCCA framework has been presented which analyses conventional as well as new construction materials at the project level and network level. Efforts presented to incorporate various cost factors such as years, users, and social cost, as well as a stochastic tackling of uncertainties, has been included. The purpose was to approach the reasonable estimate of the future performance of the newly adopted materials or techniques [36]. Similarly, A convenient method to analyses the optimized tack coat for the pavement layer is LCCA, which will help to ensure cost-effective optimum tack coat application in the field [109]. Moreover, project selection has a significant impact on fulfilling the scope of a project. A multi-commodity cost network (MMCN) model has been introduced to assist project selection and evaluation by estimating the LCCA. Although the model plays a significant role in the selection of an optimal solution a huge amount of data is required which makes the use of the MMCN model limited [110].   Integrated LCA and LCCA  The environmental efficiency of the infrastructure system is based on complex transitions in service level and infrastructure performance. LCA describes environmental effects for the lifetime of a material or project and, by quantifying environmental and social responsibilities, provides the required data for LCCA. Some studies argued that the agency cost, user costs and the environmental cost for preventing environmental damage should be allocated to a project. Adopting an LCA and LCCA approach in the design and decisionmaking phases will help and identify the most economical and environmental options, that can be utilized by all the parties involved in the planning to analyze sustainable alternatives [99]. Implementing an integrated LCA and LCCA methodology in the infrastructure approach could enhance road infrastructure management which will consider all the associated cost along with environmental protection cost. A detailed summary of the articles is shown in Table 4, where it is shown some publication adopted LCA and LCCA individually and some of the publications are focused on integrated LCA and LCCA. Besides this, the sustainability indicators highlighted by the publications are also indicated.  16 Nascimento, et al. [133] ✔ -  [19]. In many of the studies, LCA and LCCA are adopted where user cost, agency cost and environmental impact are considered whereas very few studies incorporated the environmental cost [19,25,101,128,129] as well, which is the cost utilized for the depletion of the harmful impact of the environment. Infrastructure projects affect the economic, environmental, and social system directly or indirectly, whereas it is recommended that the infrastructure agencies must review these parameters in the planning stage of a project [125]. A decision-making system introduced by integrating sustainability criteria and economic criteria, developing a model which utilizes LCA and LCCA for pavement management and selection of best alternatives between Asphalt Concrete Pavement (ACP) and Plain Cement Concrete Pavement (PCCP). The results evaluated from the analysis demonstrated that ACP is more economical than PCCP although its carbon emission is highest. Thus LCCA implementation in pavement selection is very important, as a case study, indicates that choosing concrete pavement increases the construction cost by 35 % whereas, it will reduce 2 million tons of carbon emission and 0.7 million GJ energy consumption annually [60]. Moreover, Hameed and Hancock [122] developed an integrated life cycle approach (IILCA2) that unite the LCA and LCCA by incorporating materials quantities, the environmental impact of materials in term of cost such as carbon footprint and cost of waste materials. Similarly, Wang, et al. [124] incorporated the environmental costs such as structure emissions to air, water and land and developed an environmental incorporated-LCCA model. The model was applied on a bridge to select structural material for bridge girders, taking into consideration direct, environmental, and overall initial costs. Whereas steel girders are found to have lower direct costs and environmental costs due to lower pollution, easier building practices and the higher content recycling rate in the construction phase, demonstrating greater economic and environmental efficiency in the initial level. Further, He, et al. [126] proposed a decision-making framework to integrate the LCA and LCCA to assess highway treatment events which allow to implementation of the most suitable alternative for a project. Project solutions were evaluated utilizing different environmental methods, including asphalt overlay of the warm mix, cold in-place recycling, maximum depth reclamation, intelligent compaction, and precast concrete pavement systems. Using the outcomes of life cycle evaluation with the implemented proposed framework, the professionals may help grasp the ramifications of project-level actions, conduct what-if analysis to analyses exchange between options and achieve sustainability-related organization priorities and goals. Additionally, the back-and-forth relation among the economic, environmental, and social features of infrastructure seems very tough for the decision-makers in the design phase. As a result, reducing the initial construction cost, the decision-makers compromise the environmental and social entities. A sustainable infrastructure multi-criteria preference assessment of Alternative for early design (SIMPLE-Design) strategy is formulated which incorporates the indifference curve to assess the decision-makers in dealing with the back-and-forth relationship between different alternatives [116]. Whereas, further the indifference curve needs to be extended with the inclusion of more trade-off entities to improve the decision-making in diverse scope. The LCCA, future cash flows, feedback, and incorporating the project performance with sustainability can assess the process of decision making towards the selection of sustainable options for a construction project. Interpreting the principal of LCA with LCCA to demonstrate the sustainability that asses the quality, time and cost of a project [6], which is very useful for new and repairable systems because, at some point in their life span, their operating and maintenance costs and impact will exceed their acquisition costs [117]. ✔ ✔ - ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ 3 Liljenström, et al.

He, et al. [102] developed a Decision support system with the integration of LCA and LCCA which allows the practitioners to evaluate a sustainable project alternative by identifying economic, social, and environmental impact. Similarly, Li, et al. [95] defined the Environmental Impact Evaluation (EIE) Model to analysis each of the processes that contribute to the transport life cycle of projects in which the development stage has the highest environmental impact 62.7 %, followed by the demolition 35.8 % and restoration stages 1.7 %. Data availability is one of the critical aspects in the process of LCA to evaluate a successful analysis although the acquisition of the data in the assessment is found very confusing and sometimes improper data leads to faulty computations. Park and Kim [103] built an LCA-based Environmental impact Estimate Framework that incorporates existing data during its design process to estimate the environmental impact of an earthwork type road project, however, the established model uses only limited data available in the design stage. Santos, et al. [104] He has evolved the LCC-LCA model that depends on a hybrid inventory system that enables sub-models to link each other across data sources. This provides for the monetary flows linked to the pavement life cycle structure exchanges that are specifically protected by the LCC model for which data is not accessible.   Discussion  The construction industry is one of the most important industries, which has a huge impact on the economy, environmental as well as social life [138][139][140][141]. To meet sustainability objectives, it is necessary to evaluate the activities over the life cycle of the project. LCA an LCCA are the assessment tools the evaluate the project performance in terms of environmental, social, and economical impact. Implementation of Life cycle techniques for decision-making during the planning and design stage to evaluate all the constraints related to the infrastructure project may be more cost-effective with a resilient and productive construction over the life cycle of the project. With the increasing interest in sustainability, LCA adaptation in the infrastructure projects gained significant momentum in the field of research. LCA deal with the impact of a project on the environment and social life of human being. Whereas adopting sustainability strategies, the project faces a cost issue increasing the budget of the project. To consider the economic perspectives of a project along with sustainability, the LCCA methodology got the attention of the practitioners and researchers. Likewise, LCA, the LCCA is perceived by decisionmakers to be an effective solution for assessing the economical project with improved sustainability. LCCA has a wide range of application, which allow decision-makers to compare and choose a sustainable option in terms of cost.  In the process of LCA, the impact of an infrastructure project is calculated from the materials extraction to the end life of the project where a detailed inventory is generated and integrated with impact values. The inventory generated a detailed of a project which can be further used for cost assessment. In some researches, the infrastructure project life cycle is an asset with virgin material whereas in some places recycled materials are used and compared [95]. Likewise, using RCA in the pavement could save 18 % of energy, reduce 23 % gaseous emissions, reduce 25 % pollutants whereas 35 % overall cost of the project. However, in the assessment of materials for an infrastructure project, the environmental impact is considered whereas the environmental costs are ignored. Since the environmental impact could only reduce and cannot be eliminated, which need potential attention to treat, thus consideration of environmental cost is very important in the LCCA stage. The environmental cost is the cost that could use for the treatment of the damage or reduce the impact. Besides, in several research and case studies, the LCA and LCCA are adopted individually while some focused on the integrated results of LCA and LCCA. Economic and environmental development techniques for road projects have been emphasized with proper management. Efficient management approaches enhance infrastructure performance during planning, construction, operation, and maintenance. The LCA and LCCA have a significant relation with management strategies in the decision-making stages. Whereas there is a lack of consideration of the maintenance management costs during the design process, thereby raising the environmental impact, social stresses and life-cycle cost of the project. [112]. Similarly, maintenance of operating projects is very significant, where the maintenance activities increase the cost of travellers by creating traffic delays and detours that also become a great cause of energy consumption and environmental stresses. LCA and LCCA have been described as the most developed methodology that affects different facets of infrastructure projects to optimize the cost and environmental impact ensuring a sustainable project. Besides, LCA and LCCA are known to be important approach used in the planning and design phase by decision-makers to assess the economic, environmental, and social sustainability [142][143][144].   Conceptual Framework  Based on the literature, a conceptual framework, as seen in Figure 6 has been developed to consider the impact of life cycle evaluation on various aspects of the infrastructure project and how it impacts the economy, environment, and social life.  The use of integrated LCA and LCCA is an obligatory prerequisite to efficiency regarded in infrastructure planning and management. Initially, LCA and LCCA identify appropriate solutions to the design or M&R approach. The LCA and LCCA describe initial construction and operation, the M&R activities needed for the future and the coordination of those activities. The life cycle evaluation approach can develop solutions to identify environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable technology, products, and services. The economic effects of capital expenditure are assessed by LCCA. Whereas the LCA assess the impact and potential risks associated with the project. The cost of the overall life cycle, including planning and design, development, service and repair, and disposal, should be included in assessing the agency cost and users' costs, whereas the impact of agency activities and user activities are also the key concern to identify. The embodied impact of materials, transportation of materials, the onsite machinery utilization in the construction and rehabilitation phase as well as the vehicle in the use phase impact the environment adversely. Comparably, the use phase of infrastructure project is the main part of the project which impacts the economy and environment. Consequently, for a sustainable project, their impact, and the cost to reduce the impact must be considered in the decision making of life cycle evaluation. Furthermore, the new infrastructure projects are very costly to execute, thus it is recommended and practiced rehabilitating old and existing infrastructure or assessing recycled material in the construction. The rehabilitation process impacts the environment and economy comparatively low, while the inclusion of M&R costs and impact in life cycle evaluation will enhance sustainability. moreover, most infrastructure projects ignore user activities, consequently, adversely affects the user's life.  The key parameter such as Vehicle expenditure, travelling time, and safety is the important aspects need to be considered in the life cycle of infrastructure projects. The vehicle utilizes fuel affecting the economy and emits harmful gasses affecting the environment, whereas the fuel consumption and emission of harmful gasses are proportional to the time of travel. Consequently, social sustainability is affected as the life of humans depends upon infrastructure quality, quantity, and efficiency. Thus, adopting an integrated LCA and LCCA approach to incorporate the impact and cost of agency activities and user activities will enhance the constraints of sustainability. Moreover, in the developed framework, carbon price is incorporated, which will assess the managerial activities to compensate the harmful impact due to infrastructure projects. The integration of the carbon price enhances the framework adoptability for delivering sustainable project.   Case Study  To evaluate the impact of an infrastructure project on sustainability, an integrated LCA and LCCA framework was developed. In the design and decision-making processes, the implementation of an LCA and LCCA approach is expected to define the most cost-effective and environmentally sustainable options. The introduction of an advanced infrastructure LCA and LCCA approach facilitates road infrastructure management, which considers all related costs and environmental mitigation costs. To assess the model, a case study was performed with the integrated approach of LCA and LCCA and LCA for a 1 km road construction consist of 2 lanes. The road was design based on the AASTHO standard for 20 years. The adaptation of integrated framework for the case study is shown in Figure 7.  The important data regarding the project such as pavement geometry, construction activities, construction materials, on-site equipment used for construction and related costs were collected from the resident engineer, contractor, and Communication & Work (C&W) department of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan [145]. The cost breakdown structure of the construction phase is shown in Table 5. The M&R cost was assumed and estimated by the reference project in the same area with the help of contractors and project engineers. The pavement life is considered 20 years and having a schedule M&R cycle after every 5 years for which a fixed price was allocated in the planning phase. The details about the maintenance and rehabilitation are shown in Table 6. The estimation of salvage value or End of Life Value (EOLV) of the project in Pakistan is frequently ignored. In the current case, the EOLV of the asset was calculated -5864 USD based on the ratio of end condition of the pavement multiplied by the initial construction cost using equation 1. = ( −2 4.5−2 ) *(1) Where EOLVi represents the end-of-life value of alternative i, PSIni is the pavement serviceability index of alternative i at the end of life and Ci is the initial construction cost of alternative i.   Users Data  The cost of the users is the assessment and integration of daily user vehicle cost in normal condition along with the cost of M&R activities. Due to the M&R activities, different levels of traffic jams are likely to occur in the upstream work area based on traffic volume. To take account of transport delays, speeds of vehicles must be estimated and compared against normal traffic conditions. To evaluate the users' cost during normal operation the Annual Average daily traffic (AADT) recorded 2500 with an 8.4 % growth rate annually, was obtained by the project engineers measured during the feasibility stage. The Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC) was determined by the distance travelled by the ADDT in the total days of the year multiplied by the unit rate of daily vehicle operating cost as shown in Table 7, using equation 2. The VOC was obtained by NTRC report Pakistan [146] and fuel consumption from daily fuel rates of Pakistan. = * * *(2) Where TD is the distances travelled by the vehicle, AADT is the daily traffic, Time is the number of days for which the cost to be calculated and OC is the per vehicle operating cost. Compared to the pavement normal condition, the VOC deviates from the normal condition during the M&R activities. The work zone under the maintenance activities affects the users' cost, travelling time and increases the environmental impact. Due to the insufficient data, the user cost is assumed to increase by 20 % in the normal condition. The M&R activities are scheduled after every 5 years with a maximum duration of 30 days. The users cost during the M&R phase are mentioned in Table 8.    Life Cycle Assessment  The first phase of LCA is the identification of the Goal and scope of the project. In the current LCA of pavement only the construction phase, maintenance and rehabilitation phase, and use phase are considered for assessment. The assessment of raw material acquisition and end life are omitted due to the unavailability of appropriate data provided.  In the construction phase, the impact of the pavement due to the construction activities and on-site machinery are measured. Similarly, the M&R phase is similar to the construction phase where the impact of maintenance activities and the machines used are measured. Moreover, the use phase of LCA measures the potential impact of the usage activities such as vehicle fuel consumption and emission. In the following case study user impact such as energy depletion and CO2 emissions due to on-site machinery used for construction and the vehicle and transportation are taken under consideration. The second phase of LCA is the development of Life LCI which consists of a detailed list of input and out data flow of variables for and asset or a product. The LCI for the case study is developed from the data collection stage. The inventory list contains the potential aspect of a project as shown in Table 9, that impact the environment. The equipment utilized for the construction phase is also expected the same for the rehabilitation phase activities. Similarly, the potential sources of impact in the use phase are different type of vehicles and their emissions. The third phase of LCA is the LCIA which aims to evaluate the potential impact on the surrounding resulting from the variables determined in the LCI. In the case study, only the fuel depletion and CO2 emissions by the equipment in the construction, M&R phase and the vehicles in the use phase are under consideration. During the construction phase, the daily activity and duration of activity details are provided by the project engineer. The total consumption of fuel is measured as shown in Table 10, by multiplying the hours of activities, the duration in days and the unit consumption by the machinery. During each activity, the machinery burns the fuel in the result of which the CO2 is emitted that are harmful to the environment and human health. The burning of 1-litre diesel of fuel per hours is equivalent to 2.62 kg of CO2 [147]. The total consumption of diesel fuel is converted to the equivalent of CO2 kg. Similarly, The LCIA for the use phase is measured in which the input from the LCI generated was evaluated with impact output. In the use phase, the vehicle and the rehabilitation phase are the potential sources of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The unit price of the 1-litre petrol in Pakistan was taken 0.69 USD. The total fuel consumption of the vehicles is measured by the VOC during the design period, whereas the VOC due to the work zone in rehabilitation is also highlighted being as the VOC and impact of the vehicle increase with the time delays. Then, the total amount of fuel consumption is converted to Kg where 1 litre of petrol is equal to 2.19 eq CO2 Kg as shown in Table 11.    Life Cycle Cost Analysis of road project  The relative effect on the results of the study of specific LCCs variables differs between the major and the minor values. The level of detail in the LCCA relates to the level of evaluation on the investment. Little variations in potential expense impact the reduced present value slightly. Even such considerations complicate the study in no way without enhancing the outcome of the analysis tangibly. The difficulty in identifying certain costs makes it less wise, particularly if the impact on LCCA results is at best marginal, FHWA report [148]. Following the FHWA manual, certain variables are omitted to get the best marginal outcomes.  In the final stage, the Equivalent Uniform Annual Costs (EUAC) of the case study was performed as shown in Table 12, using the NPV approach using equation 3.  = ( 1(1+ ) (1+ ) )(1) where NPV: net present value, i= discount rate, and n= years of expenditure. All the cost identified are single payment cost which is discounted to NPV. The discount rate for the uniform series cost is considered by the FWHA report [148] against each year of the payment occurring. In the process of LCCA, the agency cost and user cost are identified. Besides this, considering the carbon price to compensate for the environmental impact such as CO2 emission cost was calculated. To implement the carbon price the \"Capand-trade\" system and carbon taxes phenomena were considered in LCCA. The carbon tax or the cap and trade are the amount implemented by the government the consumers which they must pay. The carbon price is then utilized to reduce the impact of harmful emissions. The amount Eq CO2 kg were converted into tons for which an average cost of 35 USD per ton of emission was calculated as shown in Table 10 and Table 11. After conducting integrated LCA and LCCA for the case study, the impact and cost are evaluated for construction, M&R and use phase as shown in Figure 9. The construction phase is the least costly and having the least impact comparatively to the maintenance and rehabilitation phase and user phase. In the construction phase, the onsite machinery is responsible for the emission which ends with the completion of the project. Besides this, the M&R phase of the project usually cost less because of routine maintenance or scheduled maintenance activities are performed to sustain the survivability of the infrastructure. Moreover, the M&R phase has a higher impact compared to the construction phase. The impact of maintenance and rehabilitation is higher due to the activities during the service phase, which increases the emission and other environmental impacts. In the M&R phase, emissions of CO2 are summed up individually to indicate a clear impact during this phase. The user phase comparatively to the construction phase and rehabilitation phase is most costly and have a higher impact. During the user phase, the vehicles are responsible for the increases in the cost and emissions where the vehicle utilizes fossil fuel affecting the economy and discharges toxic emissions affecting the atmosphere. The use phase lasts longer than the construction phase and M&R phase, whereas the fuel consumption and emission of toxic gasses are proportional to the duration of the project. This will enhance the sustainability thresholds of an infrastructure project, the adoption of an integrated LCA and LCCA approach to include and forecasting the associated impact and costs could be during decision making could prove very effective. And enhance the project sustainability thresholds of the project.   Conclusions  A systematic literature review was performed on 55 articles consist of research papers, conference papers and review papers. PRISMA methodology was adopted for the evaluation of the extracted data from five databases namely: Scopus environmental and economic developing strategies have been highlighted for infrastructure projects, with significant interconnections in infrastructure planning and maintenance, including well-designed and well-maintained strategies that reduce costs and impact for the entire life cycle of the project. In the extracted publication it was noticed that majority of the publication were centred to LCCA and LCA approach individually, while some of the publications were focused on the integrated LCA and LCCA. In the integrated approach, all the costs associated with a project and the impact were evaluated while the environmental cost has been ignored. It has been recommended that the cost of the impact associated with the life cycle of pavements to be included throughout the life of the project which should be used to overcome the negative consequences. To incorporate the environmental cost in the integrated LCA and LCCA approach a case study was conducted to evaluate the impact of the overall project. The results of the case study indicated that the different phases of the life cycle of a project affect the economy, social life, and environment at a different level. The user phase is the most critical phase which has high cost and impact compared to other phases followed by the M&R phase.   Future Direction  The conducted case study with integrated LCA and LCC involves costs and impact related to pavement construction, maintenance and rehabilitation and user phase. For the three phases, a detailed LCA and LCA is performed with the inclusion of environmental cost such as CO2 price, whereas the materials extraction and end life of the project are omitted.  In future, a study should be performed including Material extraction and end life of the project to assess the impact and related cost including environmental cost.

An extensive LCA technique in the field of pavements is used in the analysis to estimate the marginal cost of damage to different emissions and an algorithm was developed to align the LCA with the LCCA model.In comparison with usual traffic activities, the congestive  module accounts for extra fuel usage and air pollution during construction and M&R cy- cles. Analysing the results of the LCA implementations, streamlined maintenance  schemes costs are decreased by 5.9-10.2 % and by holistic costs relative to previous opti- mization schemes by 8.2-12.3 %, compared with the influence of energy/GHG assess- ments [25].  Zhang, et al. [129] studied the pavement system with an LCA and LCCA integrated Life  Cycle Optimization (LCO) model, where an energy savings of 5-30 %, Reduction of 4-40  % GHS pollution, while concrete costs decreased by 0.4-12 %, was reported. With 50.0 %  Recycled Asphalt pavement (RAP), energy consumption was reduced by 3 % and gaseous  emissions were reduced by 14 % for CO2, 23 % for SO2 and 15 % for CH4, N2O and NO    Table 5 . 5Construction phase cost breakdownComponent Activities  Qty  Unit  Total Cost  (USD)  1 Clearing and Grubbing by mechanical means  1829.00  m2  185  2 Compaction of Natural Ground  1829.00  m2  229   3   Formation of Embankment from Borrow Excavation in  Common Material including compaction Modified  AASHTO 90 % by power roller.   1114.38  m3  5,505   4  Grooving in existing BT road of size 4x4 cm @ 2-meter  c/c.  3657.99  m2  1,167   5 Granular Subbase Course using Pit Run Gravel  278.60  m3  2,508  6 Water Bound Macadam Base Course  746.64  m3  11,760  7 Bituminous Prime Coat  3657.99  m2  4,350   8  Asphaltic Wearing Course (Asphalt Batch Plant Hot  Mixed)  186.10  m3  21,871    Table 6 . 6Maintenance and Rehabilitation cost breakdownComponent Activity  Year  Cost (USD)  M&R # 1  5  10,000   M&R # 2  10  10,000   M&R # 3  15  10,000  Total M&R Cost  30,000     Table 7 . 7Vehicle Operating Cost during normal condition Preprints (www.preprints.org) | NOT PEER-REVIEWED | Posted: 11 March 2021 doi:10.20944/preprints202103.0316.v1Vehicle  Type   USD/  1000km  USD/1km  AADT  Duration   VOC  (USD)  (1 st Year)   AADT  Growth  Rate   AADT  (20 th Year)   VOC  (USDD)  (20 th Year)     Table 8 . 8Vehicle Operating Cost during Maintenance and RehabilitationComponent Activity  Year   Activity  Duration  (days)   VOCnc  (USD)   VOC Increase  (%)   VOCRehb  (USD)   M&R # 1 Work zone user cost  5  30  174,481  20 %  209,377  M&R # 2 Work zone user cost  10  30  174,481  20 %  209,377  M&R # 3 Work zone user cost  15  30  174,481  20 %  209,377  Total  628,132     Table 9 . 9Life-Cycle InventoryConstruction  Equipment  Fuel Type  Unit   Construction and Rehabilitation phase  Excavator  Diesel  L/hr  Road Roller  Diesel  L/hr  Road Roller  Diesel  L/hr  Grader tractor  Diesel  L/hr  Road roller  Diesel  L/hr  Bitumen Sprayer  Diesel  L/hr    Table 10 . 10Construction phase fuel consumption and CO2 emissionConstruction  Equipement   Daily  Activity  (Hr)   Duration  (days)   Total  hours   Unit  Consumption  (l/hr)   Total  Consumtion  (l/hr)   Eq CO2  kg   Eq  CO2  Tons   CO2 Cost  (USD/Ton)   Excavator  8.00  5  40  8  320  838  1  29  Road Roller  8.00  12  96  10  960  2,515  3  88  Road Roller  8.00  10  80  10  800  2,096  2  73  Grader tractor  8.00  12  96  6  576  1,509  2  53  Road roller  8.00  15  120  10  1,200  3,144  3  110  Bitumen  Sprayer  8.00  10  80  9  720  1,886  2  66   Paver  8.00  8  64  12  768  2,012  2  70   Total  5,344  14,001  14  490     Table 11 . 11Maintenance and Rehabilitation phase fuel consumption and CO2 emissionComponent  Year  Energy   Source   Total   cost   (USD)   USD/L  litre  Eq CO2 kg Eq CO2 Tons  CO2 Cost   (USD/Ton)   Car  20  Petrol  464,869  0.69  673,723  1,610,198  1,610  56,357   Passenger  20  Petrol  430,843  0.69  624,410  1,492,339  1,492  52,232   Busses  20  Petrol  882,219  0.69  1,278,578  3,055,802  3,056  106,953   Trucks  20  Petrol  718,760  0.69  1,041,681  2,489,617  2,490  87,137    Table 12 . 12Life cycle cost analysis of road projectCost Component Activity  Cost  Discount Rate Years  P/F  NPV   (USD)  i  n   Initial construction Cost  48,863  1  1  0.5  24,432   Construction CO2Cost  490  1  1  0.5  245   Rehab #1  10,000  0.7835  5  0.055416  554   Rehab #1 User Cost  209,377  0.7835  5  0.055416  11,603   Rehab #2  10,000  0.6139  10  0.008341  83   Rehab #2 User Cost  209,377  0.6139  10  0.008341  1,746   Rehab #3  10,000  0.481  15  0.002765  28   Rehab #2 User Cost  209,377  0.481  15  0.002765  579   User cost for normal years  1,868,559  0.3769  20  0.001667  3,115     , Web of science, Emerald, and Science Direct.

In the infrastructure systems, rapid growth is found, where the economic and sustainable impact has become a topic of significant concern for policies and government officials. To achieve constraints of sustainable development, all the policies and actions over the infrastructure project's life cycle must be assessed. Decision-makers have adopted approaches for economic, social, and environmental initiatives through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost Analyses (LCCA) of infrastructure projects. The purpose of this review is to highlight the impact of performing LCA and LCCA in infrastructure projects. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review methodology is adopted in which renowned databases, i.e., Web of Science, Science Direct, Emerald and Scopus were selected to extract the relevant literature. Using the PRISMA approach, 1251 publications were identified which were then filtered and 55 documents were included in the final review. In the extracted publications most, researchers were biased toward LCA and LCA individually, whereas few focused on integrated LCA and LCCA. The researchers assessed the costs and impact associated with the infrastructure project while there were less focused on the environmental cost. Besides this, techniques of economic, social, and environmental growth of infrastructure projects have been emphasized during the design phase because of substantial relations between infrastructure design and operation management. Moreover, a conceptual framework has been developed that will assist the decision-makers to consider the effects of LCA and LCCA on various aspects of the infrastructure project and how it impacts sustainability. In the last, a case study was performed to assess the developed framework with the incorporation of environmental impact cost.\n","=============================\n","Full Text: INTRODUÇÃO  Os estudos relativos à fragilidade dos ambientes são de significativa importância para o planejamento territorial, pois se trata de um instrumento cuja finalidade é identificar e analisar os ambientes em função de seus diferentes níveis de vulnerabilidade, principalmente frente aos processos erosivos, aos deslizamentos de encostas, ao assoreamento de cursos de água e às inundações.  Para se obter um panorama das condições de vulnerabilidade do sistema é necessário, segundo Ross (1994), realizar um estudo integrado dos elementos componentes do estrato geográfico que dão suporte à vida animal e ao homem, os quais analisados e interrelacionados geram um produto analítico-sintético que retrata a situação da área de estudo.  Esta análise integrada permite obter um diagnóstico das diferentes categorias hierárquicas da fragilidade dos ambientes naturais, resultando na carta síntese de Fragilidade/Vulnerabilidade Ambiental.  A carta de fragilidade ambiental, ainda segundo Ross (1991), auxilia o diagnóstico-síntese que pode perfeitamente nortear as intervenções antrópicas futuras e corrigir as presentes.É, portanto, um instrumento importante no trabalho de planejamento físico territorial.  Este mapeamento da fragilidade ambiental se constitui num passo indispensável à medida que, atualmente, é cada vez mais necessário conhecer e compreender a dinâmica do sistema e as transformações dele decorrentes para subsidiar o planejamento nas definições das ações prioritárias a serem tomadas, destinadas a assegurar a qualidade dos recursos hídricos e do solo, e a conservação da biodiversidade.Dada à importância deste tema existem diversos modelos metodológicos aplicados aos estudos da fragilidade para fins de ordenamento territorial, os quais estabelecem o grau de vulnerabilidade dos sistemas, visando promover o uso dos recursos naturais da melhor forma possível.  Dentre estes modelos empíricos podem ser citados dois modelos propostos por Ross (1994), um com apoio nos Índices de Dissecação do Relevo, e o outro com apoio nas Classes de Declividade; e ainda o modelo sugerido por Crepani et al. (2001) com apoio em Unidades Territoriais Básicas (UTBs).Os três modelos são amplamente utilizados.  Estes modelos têm como ponto comum o entendimento da inter-relação dos elementos do meio físico e biótico.Utilizam praticamente as mesmas variáveis, no entanto apresentam diferentes formas de calcular a vulnerabilidade, assim como \"pesos\" distintos para cada uma destas variáveis envolvidas na obtenção dos graus de fragilidade.  O modelo proposto por Crepani et al. (2001) trabalha com valores médios para o produto final, e Ross (1994) trabalha com o agrupamento dos índices das variáveis e adota o relevo como variável principal.As formas de cálculo para obtenção dos graus de fragilidade refletem as diferentes maneiras de ponderar a importância das variáveis avaliadas.Por exemplo, no modelo de análise proposto por Crepani et al. (2001), a utilização da média aritmética entre as variáveis pressupõe que todas elas têm a mesma importância (peso) para o estabelecimento do grau de fragilidade.No modelo de análise sugerido por Ross (1994) a variável que representa o 1º dígito da associação numérica determina o grau de fragilidade, enquanto que as demais variáveis apenas hierarquizam nuances desta fragilidade.Deste modo, a variável relevo (1º dígito) é que determina o grau de fragilidade.Sendo assim, no modelo proposto por Crepani et al. (op. cit.) todas as variáveis têm o mesmo peso, já no modelo proposto por Ross (1994) o relevo tem uma importância muito maior na definição dos graus de fragilidade do que as demais variáveis.  Como conseqüência destas diferenças técnico-operacionais os mapas sínteses resultantes da aplicação destes modelos apresentam resultados bastante divergentes, conforme exposto em Spörl (2001).  Deve-se também ressaltar que algumas pesquisas que correlacionam resultados da aplicação destes modelos de fragilidade ambiental e da investigação de campo demonstram que nem sempre os resultados são convergentes.Como exemplos, podem ser citados os trabalhos de Nakashima (1999) e de Rodrigues (1998), os quais mostram que freqüentemente os resultados dos modelos não condizem com as respostas da natureza.  Análises e comparações realizadas em Spörl (2007) demonstram que esses modelos apresentam certas deficiências.O principal problema observado está relacionado à atribuição de \"pesos\" às variáveis.Estes pesos devem indicar a contribuição relativa de cada uma das variáveis (relevo, solo, rocha, cobertura vegetal e clima) na determinação do grau de fragilidade de uma área.  Essas deficiências apresentadas pelos modelos são resultantes da grande dificuldade em ajustar os modelos propostos de análise da Fragilidade Ambiental de maneira a conciliá-los com os fenômenos complexos da natureza.  Diante destas constatações surge uma incerteza na questão da confiabilidade destes modelos.Desta forma, verifica-se a necessidade de que todo modelo deve ser testado, validado e, mais importante ainda, ser falseado.Os modelos devem estar num contínuo processo de busca de erros para a sua depuração.Pode-se dizer que o objetivo mais importante é verificar sob quais condições o modelo não funciona, ou seja, verificar e comprovar quais as suas limitações.Openshaw et al. (1997) reporta que há a necessidade de considerar a reengenharia de modelos existentes através da Computação Inteligente, a fim de explorar sua nãolinearidade, adaptabilidade, incerteza etc. Desta forma, busca-se neste trabalho contribuir no aperfeiçoamento dos modelos de  Fragilidade Ambiental e no desenvolvimento de uma nova metodologia para a elaboração de modelos aplicando-se Redes Neurais Artificiais (RNAs), onde possam ser minimizadas as limitações apresentadas nos modelos já existentes.  As Redes Neurais Artificiais (RNAs) são algoritmos computacionais que apresentam um modelo matemático inspirado na estrutura neural de organismos inteligentes tentando emular em máquinas (computadores) o funcionamento do cérebro humano, ainda que de maneira simplificada.Assim como o cérebro humano, a RNA é capaz de aprender e tomar decisões baseadas em seu próprio aprendizado.Desta forma, a RNA pode ser interpretada como um esquema de processamento capaz de armazenar conhecimento baseado em aprendizagem (experiência) e disponibilizar este conhecimento para a aplicação em questão.  As RNAs são amplamente utilizadas para soluções de problemas complexos, onde o comportamento das variáveis não é rigorosamente conhecido.São utilizadas nas mais diversas áreas do conhecimento, principalmente em aplicações que envolvam reconhecimento de padrões, assim como, análise de séries temporais, diagnósticos médicos, previsões no mercado financeiro, etc.  Diante do exposto, a RNA é capaz de reconhecer padrões, ou seja, possui a capacidade de aprender por meio de exemplos e de generalizar a informação aprendida, gerando um modelo não-linear, o que torna a sua aplicação na análise espacial bastante eficiente.  O sucesso das RNAs para modelar sistemas dinâmicos em vários campos da ciência e da engenharia sugere que elas também possam ser aplicadas nos modelos de fragilidade ambiental.A utilização das RNAs na análise ambiental disponibiliza essa nova ferramenta para decisões complexas, que envolvem muitos critérios, sendo que a seleção dos critérios, assim como a definição de seus pesos, são avaliações arbitrárias e subjetivas, dificultando o processo de análise.   OBJETIVOS  Os principais objetivos deste estudo são gerar discussões a respeito dos métodos de construção dos modelos empíricos existentes, desenvolver e testar as redes neurais artificiais (RNAs) como uma nova alternativa metodológica para a elaboração de modelos de análise da fragilidade ambiental.Pretende-se assim testar a viabilidade e a confiabilidade desta nova ferramenta nesses modelos, adotando as seguintes etapas:  Implementar um sistema de apoio à tomada de decisão através do reconhecimento de padrões adotados por especialistas da área de domínio, utilizando RNAs e adotando-se a metodologia proposta por Castro (1998) como base para uma nova abordagem do modelo de fragilidade ambiental;  Testar essa nova ferramenta proposta para análise da fragilidade ambiental, as RNAs, no reconhecimento do padrão de avaliação dos especialistas consultados; Apresentar e aplicar os modelos empíricos existentes de fragilidade ambiental propostos por Ross (1994) e por Crepani et al. (2001) em duas áreas-teste para comparar o desempenho destes modelos em diferentes cenários;  Comparar os modelos empíricos propostos por Ross (op.cit.) e por Crepani et al. (op. cit.) com os resultados gerados pelo treinamento das suas respectivas RNAs.   MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS  A modelagem da fragilidade ambiental é um desafio, pois apresenta duas grandes dificuldades: a primeira, é entender o comportamento das variáveis ambientais diante dos mecanismos que atuam na vulnerabilidade do sistema, e a outra, é traduzir, o mais fielmente possível, esse conhecimento para um sistema de equações matemáticas, o modelo.  Dada às propriedades e amplas possibilidades de utilização das redes neurais artificiais (RNA), esta ferramenta de Inteligência Artificial foi testada neste estudo como alternativa à elaboração de modelos de fragilidade ambiental, visando minimizar as limitações dos modelos já existentes.  As RNAs foram treinadas com conhecimentos extraídos a partir de simulações (realizadas através de um programa de pesquisa) de processos de escolha, assim reconhecendo e assimilando os padrões de decisão adotados pelos especialistas consultados.  Desta forma, para aplicar as RNAs nesta nova proposta metodológica foram necessárias as seguintes etapas: 1ª etapa -compor um conjunto de treinamento para as RNAs; 2ª etapa -aprendizado (treinamento), onde as redes aprendem por meio de exemplos; 3ª etapa -as redes extraem as informações relevantes dos padrões de informação que lhe são apresentados; 4ª etapa -as redes reconhecem e assimilam os padrões de avaliação adotados pelos especialistas.  Visando obter um conjunto de treinamento a ser aplicado nas RNAs foram utilizados alguns programas especialmente desenvolvidos para uma pesquisa junto aos entrevistados (especialistas).Estes programas serviram como ferramentas para atribuir uma escala às notas das alternativas e aos pesos de cada variável selecionada (declividade dominante, solos, rochas, cobertura vegetal/uso da terra e intensidade pluviométrica), conforme os critérios de avaliação de cada entrevistado.Desta forma, pode-se considerar que os modelos existentes (CREPANI et al., 2001e ROSS, 1994), são baseados na composição de variáveis de diferentes importâncias relativas.Estas importâncias (pesos) são fornecidas empiricamente pelos próprios autores, enquanto neste estudo elas são os resultados obtidos através do treinamento das redes neurais artificiais.  Para fins comparativos, também foram avaliados neste estudo, para as mesmas áreas-teste, os modelos já consagrados propostos por Ross (1994)  As grandes divergências entre os modelos foram confirmadas pelos coeficientes de correlação calculados para verificar o grau de associação entre estes dois modelos.Os coeficientes calculados são r = 0,64 e r = -0,05 para as áreas-teste 1 e 2, respectivamente.  Ou seja, para a Área-teste 1 os modelos apresentaram uma correlação moderada, entretanto, para a Área-teste 2 não houve correlação (\"r\" próximo de zero).  Estes resultados podem ser justificados pelas diferentes metodologias utilizadas pelos dois modelos, ressaltando assim as diferentes ponderações (importâncias) relativas das variáveis.  No modelo proposto por Crepani et al. (2001)  Estes resultados foram confirmados pelos coeficientes de correlação calculados para verificar o grau de associação entre estes dois modelos.Os coeficientes calculados são r = 0,73 e r = 0,66 para as áreas-teste 1 e 2, respectivamente.Nestes dois casos, os modelos apresentaram uma correlação moderada.  Modelo Ross (1994) x Modelo RNA Ross  As comparações entre o modelo proposto por Ross (1994) e o modelo que utiliza a RNA treinada com dados fornecidos por este especialista deixa claro o contraste significativo apresentado pelos resultados da aplicação destes modelos, principalmente na Área-teste 2.  Os coeficientes de correlação calculados para verificar o grau de associação entre estes dois modelos indicaram para a Área-teste 1 um valor de r = 0,26, e para a Área-teste 2 r = -0,60.  Estes coeficientes demonstram uma fraca correlação entre os modelos na Área-teste 1, e correlação negativa na Área-teste 2, neste caso sugerindo que quando em um dos modelos os valores de fragilidade crescem, no outro, os valores diminuem.  Deve-se lembrar que no modelo proposto por Ross (1994)     Este problema apresentado pelos modelos se justifica, pois a construção de modelos é uma tarefa complexa, na qual é difícil ajustar seus parâmetros para traduzir exatamente a experiência e os conhecimentos adquiridos pelos especialistas.   CONCLUSÕES  Os resultados apresentados nesta pesquisa dão uma idéia de quão complexa é a modelagem dos sistemas ambientais.O processo da modelagem da fragilidade ambiental é um grande desafio, pois implica em compreender de forma qualitativa e quantitativa a relação entre as variáveis ambientais e a dinâmica extremamente complexa que envolve estas componentes físicas, bióticas e sócio-econômicas.  Diante das dificuldades de se modelar a fragilidade ambiental, entende-se que mesmo havendo um razoável conhecimento qualitativo e empírico da dinâmica do sistema, este entendimento não é facilmente traduzido em modelos matemáticos.  A Rede Neural Artificial (RNA) se mostrou eficiente para fazer essa tradução.Os resultados comprovam a expectativa inicial de que é possível emular, com razoável confiabilidade, o padrão de avaliação de especialistas na definição da fragilidade dos sistemas ambientais.  132  Houve eficiência da RNA em reconhecer o padrão de avaliação adotado por todos os especialistas.  Podem ser citadas algumas vantagens e desvantagens das RNAs:  Vantagens da RNA:  capacidade em lidar com grande número de informações; leva em consideração qualquer número de fatores, por mais insignificantes que sejam os efeitos de cada um deles.  Desvantagens da RNA:  ferramenta geralmente não familiar aos geógrafos; modelo de fundamentação teórica mais complexo, menos intuitivo para ser compreendido como ferramenta.  Ainda assim, os algoritmos que emulam as RNAs são evidentemente mais complexos, mas de uma complexidade muito menor do que aquela apresentada pelos sistemas ambientais.  Da economia à medicina, todas as áreas do conhecimento têm adotado, em maior ou menor grau, tecnologias cujos princípios detalhados de funcionamento não são familiares aos seus profissionais.O mercado financeiro, por exemplo, aplica diversos modelos preditivos, alguns baseados em redes neurais artificiais, e a medicina faz uso de ressonância magnética como ferramenta de diagnóstico, além de muitos outros exemplos.  Caso a geografia também queira ter a sua disposição ferramentas mais eficientes, ela deve estar preparada para incorporar, sem preconceitos, o que a tecnologia pode oferecer, por mais áridos que sejam os mecanismos internos destes sistemas.  Uma importante contribuição deste trabalho foi ter dado um passo em busca destas novas técnicas, que ainda estão muito longe de terem sido devidamente exploradas na Ciência Geográfica.Técnicas que podem ser às vezes temidas pelos geógrafos, mas necessárias para a evolução deste campo do conhecimento.

Estes programas foram apresentados a seis especialistas, inclusive Crepani e Ross (autores dos dois modelos empíricos também analisados neste trabalho), na forma de simulações onde os mesmos foram requisitados a fazer várias avaliações comparativas sempre entre duas alternativas ou cenários.Sem essa valiosa colaboração dos especialistas, certamente esse trabalho não teria credibilidade.Para aplicação destas simulações foram utilizados programas desenvolvidos especificamente para esta finalidade, onde foram apresentadas aos especialistas todas as combinações de valores (dois a dois) das alternativas frente as variáveis em estudo.Em cada combinação, o especialista foi requisitado a efetuar uma avaliação comparativa.Para escalonar as alternativas na avaliação global foi adotado o mesmo procedimento.Este procedimento permite realizar sucessivas comparações para determinar uma espécie de ranking entre os elementos avaliados, sendo que estes dados compilados constituíram a base de informações para o reconhecimento dos padrões de análise de cada especialista consultado.Estas simulações foram responsáveis por compor um conjunto de treinamento para as RNAs, sendo executadas a partir de três diferentes programas adaptados para este trabalho.Os programas desenvolvidos são:Pesquisa de CalibraçãoEste programa tem como finalidade familiarizar e treinar os entrevistados a utilizar o sistema de avaliação implementado, conforme apresentado na Figura 01.

In soils and sediments (oxi)hydroxides exist as nodules, concretions, cement between particles, or simply as a coating on particles (Tessier at al., 1979).They regulate the concentration of plant nutrients such as phosphate and inorganic (heavy metals) and organic pollutants and function as an adsorbent and an electron accep-tor during dissimilatory metabolism of micro-organisms under anoxic conditions.The iron oxides in natural surface environments are often poorly crystalline, i.e. the crystals are nano-sized, do not clearly exhibit the typical morphology of well-crystalline forms, are rich in defects and contain impurities.Due to their striking colors (ranging from red to yellow) and their high surface area, small concentrations of (oxi)hydroxide color the soils and rocks in which they are mixed (Schwertmann and Cornell, 2000).  The identifi cation of Fe (oxi)hydroxides in soil by X-ray diffraction (XRD) may be complicated due to their small amounts, overlapping of diagnostic lines with those of associated minerals and the poor crystallinity of some phases (Durn et al., 2001).For identifi cation and even quantifi cation of secondary Fe (oxi)hydroxides in soils, several selective dissolution treatments can be used.The most useful among them are an acid ammonium oxalate treatment and dithionite-citrate bicarbonate (DCB) treatment.The former treatment dissolves only poorly crystalline phases, predominately fer-  The Mining-Geology-Petroleum Engineering Bulletin, 2017, pp.9-14 © The Author(s), DOI: 10.17794/rgn.2017.2.2 rihydrite (Schwertmann, 1964;Schwertmann et al., 1982;Schwertmann and Taylor, 1989), while the dithionite-citrate bicarbonate treatment proposed by Mehra and Jackson (1960) dissolves practically all secondary Fe (oxi)hydroxides (Schwertmann and Taylor, 1989).Quantifi cation of Fe (oxi)hydroxides is done by analysing iron content in a solution after selective dissolution.  As (oxi)hydroxides are excellent scavengers for trace metals (Tessier at al., 1979;Burgos et al., 2012), different (oxi)hydroxide selective dissolution treatments are used in selective leaching schemes for soil and sediments.These treatments are used for pollutant release assessment in the frame of environmental geochemistry, as well as for ore deposits prospection in the frame of exploration geochemistry.Except earlier mentioned reagents, as Fe (oxi)hydroxides are thermodynamically unstable under anoxic conditions (i.e., low Eh), other strong reducing agents are used (e.g.hydroxylamine in hydrochloric acid; sodium-EDTA) (e.g.Borggaard, 1979;Miko et al., 2003;Mileusnić et al., 2014).  In selective leaching procedures, regardless of the purpose (removal of (oxy)hydroxide prior to clay minerals analysis or determination of metals in soil/sediments sequential fractions, it is very important to preserve the entire undissolved residue.Therefore, the objectives of the study were: (1) to fi nd the most effective reagent rinsing method which follow the dissolution of (oxy)hydroxides using dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate; and (2) to test if the content of Fe (oxi)hydroxides could be determined gravimetrically.The purpose of the study was to optimize the analytical methods used in our laboratory.The following reagent rinsing methods were tested: (1) centrifugation, (2) fi ltration, (3) dialysis.   Materials and Methods  The analysed sample (K-2; laboratory number 4954) represents a B horizon of polygenetic soil developed on Cretaceous limestone at the site Dobranje in the hinterland of the Neretva River valley, 7 km north-east of the lake Kuti.The sample location is designated as shallow terra rossa on the Basic Soil Map -sheet Mljet 2 (Martinović, 1978).  The moisture content of the sample was determined from weight loss on drying at 105°C for 24 h.Sample preparation included: (1) removal of possible traces of carbonates using 5% acetic acid (followed by 5 times rinsing with distilled water and centrifugation at 3800 rpm for 15 minutes); and (2) removal of organic matter using 30% hydrogen peroxide (followed by evaporation).The obtained material was milled in an agate mortar.Mineral content of the original sample, as well after carbonate and organic matter removal, was determined using X-ray diffraction (Philips diffractometer PW1710).  Further, material left was divided in 9 sub-samples.All nine sub-samples were subjected to dissolution of (oxy)hydroxides using dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB) as follows:  1 g of each sub-sample was treated with 40 ml of 0.3 M sodium citrate and 10 ml of 1 M sodium bicarbonate solution and heated on a water bath at temperature of 80°C for 15 minutes.After heating, 0.5 g of sodium dithionite was added and allowed to react.Addition of sodium dithionite was repeated after 15 minutes and again left to react.Reaction caused fading of the sample color.After cooling, the sample was centrifuged at 3800 rpm, 10 minutes, and the supernatant was decanted into a volumetric fl ask.Concentrations of iron in supernatants were analyzed by fl ame atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAnalyst 700 Perkin Elmer) using an iron hollow cathode lamp at wavelength 302.1.The insoluble residues were mixed with 50 ml of distilled water and dispersed.Three sub-samples were used for the testing of each rinsing method: centrifugation, fi ltration and dialysis.The fraction of soil which was dissolved by reduction (DCB treatment) is named \"the reducible fraction\".This fraction is mainly composed of Fe (oxi)hydroxides.It can contain traces of Mn (oxi)hydroxides and other phases soluble in a reductive environment.   Rinsing by centrifugation  Three sub-samples (A1, A2 and A3) were centrifuged at 3800 rpm for 20 minutes.After the fi rst centrifugation the supernatant was not clear, therefore the centrifugation was prolonged for 20 minutes.Still the supernatant was not clear.At this point, the supernatant was decanted in beakers, and sub-samples were rinsed with another 50 ml of distilled water by centrifugation at 3800 rpm for 40 minutes.The second supernatant was more limpid than the fi rst one.The content of colloidal particles was monitored by measuring the transmittance at 550 nm using Specol 1100 spectrophotometer (Analytik Jena AG, Germany).Rinsing was repeated fi ve times.Supernatants were tested for the presence of sulphate using 0.1 M BaCl 2 .The test was negative in the fi fth supernatant.The process of rinsing using centrifugation followed by decantation lasted roughly 4 hours.All three sub-samples were dried and weighed.   Rinsing by fi ltration  Filtration was performed using \"Blue Ribbon\" fi lter paper (IDL GmbH & Co. KG Laborgroßhandel für Europa) designed for fi ltering suspensions of small particles.For 1 sub-sample (B1) one fi lter paper was used, while for the two other sub-samples (B2 and B3), two fi lter papers were used.However the particles were too small, and they passed through both fi lter papers.Therefore, the fi ltrate was returned into the funnel.Even after the second fi ltration, the fi ltrate was not clear.To accelerate the fi ltration reduced pressure was used.The initial fi lter paper was used till the end of the fi ltration.The presence of sulphate was tested using 0.1 M BaCl 2 .Rinsing by fi ltration using fi lter paper lasted roughly 7-8 hours.All three sub-samples were dried and weighed.   Rinsing by dialysis  Dialysis, a common laboratory technique, is the process of separating molecules in a solution by the difference in their rates of diffusion through a semipermeable membrane, such as dialysis tubing.Among different uses, its most common application is for the removal of unwanted small molecules.In this study, dialysis tubing (19.00 mm, Medicell International Ltd., London) were fi rst soaked in distilled water.Subsequently, the three sub-samples suspensions were poured into the dialysis tubing, tied and placed in a beakers with distilled water.Conductivity of distilled water, as well as water in which dialysis tubing was immersed, was measured using a conductivity meter (WTW Multi 340i -oximeter conductivity meter pH meter, WTW Germany).The water in the beaker was exchanged till the water after soaking did not change its conductivity.All three sub-samples were dried and weighed.After homogenization in the agate mortar, XRD analysis of the subsamples was performed.   Results and Discussion   Characterisation of analysed sample  The analysed sample of terra rossa soil contains quartz, hematite, goethite and clay minerals.After acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide treatments, there was no change in diffraction pattern (see Figure 1).The moisture content of the sample was 2.08± 0.02%.The Fe 2 O 3 content, recalculated from the concentration of iron determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy after dissolution of sub-samples in the dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate, is presented in Table 1.Each sub-sample was measured in triplicate.Relative standard deviations (RSD) for all sub-samples are below 1%.The mean value of Fe 2 O 3 content is 5.12 +/-0.10%.   The reducible fraction content in analysed sample determined by gravimetric analysis  Effi ciency of iron (oxy)hydroxide removal is presented in Figure 2. The reducible fraction content determined by gravimetric analysis following the different rinsing methods is presented in Table 2 and Figure 3.   Centrifugation  The subsamples (A1-A3) were rinsed 5 times with the distilled water to completely remove all electrolytes (the removal was proven by barium chloride).Following each rinsing step, the transmittance of the supernatant   was measured (see Table 3) in order to determine the effectiveness of the centrifugation.The transmittance data showed that the most incoming radiation passed through the supernatant after the fi rst three steps; this indicated a signifi cant particle content in supernatant after the fourth and fi fth steps of rinsing, which refl ected a loss of material.Hence, centrifugation is a rapid method (it lasted 4 hours in total), but it can lead to a loss of material, particularly of the smallest particles.High sedimentation speeds and/or longer centrifugation times are needed to ensure complete sedimentation of submicron particles.The diffi culties with highly dispersed suspensions may be overcome by adjusting the pH of the rinsing water close to the point of zero charge (PZC) of the oxide (usually pH 7-8).In that case, fl occulation is facilitated (Schwertmann and Cornell, 2000).  The Mining-Geology-Petroleum Engineering Bulletin, 2017, pp.9-14 © The Author(s), DOI: 10.17794/rgn.2017.2.2   Filtration  Although fi ltration was performed using the \"Blue Ribbon\" fi lter paper designed for fi ltering suspensions of very small particles, it was found to be an ineffi cient rinsing method.Therefore, two fi lter papers were used for the sub-samples B2 and B3.However, the particles were too small, and they passed through both of them.Hence, the fi ltration using 0.45 pm millipore fi lter under vacuum should be tested.Though, in the case of large quantities of suspension or with very small particles (e. g. ferrihydrite), the clogging of the fi lter pores makes the method impracticably slow (Schwertmann and Cornell, 2000).   Dialysis  Dialysis was found to be the most effective rinsing method.However, the colour of the solution in the dialysis tubing after rinsing was not clear, but beige in colour.The conductivity measurements (see Table 4) and rinsing were performed till the conductivity of the surrounding water was equal to that of distilled water.The disadvantage of dialysis was the long duration time of its completion which lasted 1 week.tially toxic elements.This study was focused on the rinsing methods following the DCB selective leaching procedure widely used for: 1/ quantifi cation; 2/ sample preparation for clay analysis; and 3/ determination of coprecipitated trace elements.The following reagent rinsing methods were tested: (1) centrifugation, (2) fi ltration, (3) dialysis.The analysis was conducted on the red soil sample containing 5.12% Fe 2 O 3 .The time needed for rinsing increased in the order: centrifugation (4 h) < fi ltration (7 h) < dialysis (1 week).The amount of gravimetrically determined dissolved reducible fraction upon rinsing varied signifi cantly depending on the method and it was remarkably higher than the amount of Fe 2 O 3 determined by analysing iron content in leachate.The most effective reagent rinsing method which followed the dissolution of (oxy)hydroxides using dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate was found to be dialysis.No loss of sample is the advantage of this method, but its disadvantage was the time needed for its completion.The centrifugation was relatively rapid, but it can lead to a loss of the smaller particles.In this case the loss was unacceptably high.The fi ltration using fi lter paper was more time consuming than the centrifugation, and it showed the least acceptable results.Filtration using the 0.45 pm millipore fi lter under vacuum conditions will be tested in the future.It should be relatively rapid and satisfactory, especially for samples with a signifi cant amount of small particles.  The following conclusions can be drawn from this study:  1) The content of Fe (oxi)hydroxides cannot be determined gravimetrically upon selective leaching.2) Rinsing of reagents after Fe (oxi)hydroxides removal prior to clay mineral analysis should be carefully selected and performed, especially in the case of small particle presence (e.g.smectites).3) Centrifugation, the commonly accepted rinsing method in all sequential extraction procedures, can lead to incorrect results.Hence, to accomplish sedimentation, higher speed or longer centrifugation times are necessary in some cases.   Conclusion  Iron (oxy)hydroxides represent one of the most important groups of minerals in the context of environmental geochemistry and mineralogy.Being secondary minerals, formed at the surface conditions as weathering products of ferromagnesian rock minerals, they are usually very small in size (large specifi c surface area) and have defects in the structure (often positively charged).Hereby, they greatly adsorb nutrients as well as poten-  Figure 1 : 1 Figure 1: The diff raction patterns of the terra rossa sample prior to and following acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide treatments (Legend: red -original sample, blue -insoluble residue, CM -clay minerals; Qtz -quartz, Gt -goethite; Hem -haematite).

U postupcima selektivnoga otapanja, bilo da su namijenjeni uklanjanju (oksi)hidroksida prije analize minerala gline ili za određivanje metala u reducirajućoj frakciji tla/sedimenta, vrlo je važno sačuvati cijeli neotopljeni ostatak. Stoga su ciljevi ovoga rada bili: (1) odrediti najučinkovitiju metodu ispiranja reagensa nakon otapanja (oksi)hidroksida i (2) provjeriti može li se sadržaj željezova (oksi)hidroksida odrediti gravimetrijski. Testirane su sljedeće metode ispiranja: (1) centrifugiranje, (2) fi ltriranje, (3) dijaliza. Analiza je provedena na uzorku crvenice koji sadržava 5,12 % Fe2O3. Vrijeme potrebno za ispiranje povećava se ovim redoslijedom: centrifugiranje < fi ltriranje < dijaliza. Udio gravimetrijski određene otopljene frakcije znatno se razlikuje ovisno o odabranoj metodi ispiranja te je neusporedivo veći od udjela Fe2O3 određenoga mjerenjem željeza u ekstraktu nakon otapanja. Najučinkovitija metoda ispiranja ditionit-citrat-bikarbonata nakon otapanja (oksi)hidroksida jest dijaliza. Prednost je ove metode u tome što nema gubitka uzorka, a nedostatak je vrijeme potrebno za njezino provođenje. Centrifugiranje je relativno brza metoda, no može dovesti do gubitka sitnih čestica. U ovome istraživanju gubitak je bio neprihvatljivo velik. Filtriranje pomoću fi ltarskoga papira oduzima više vremena od centrifugiranja te je pokazalo najlošije rezultate. Na temelju rezultata možemo zaključiti: (1) sadržaj željezova (oksi)hidroksida ne može se odrediti gravimetrijski nakon selektivnoga otapanja; (2) način ispiranja reagensa nakon uklanjanja željezova (oksi)hidroksida pri pripremi uzoraka za analizu minerala glina. ; Željezovi, Pedologiji, oksi)hidroksidi imaju važnu ulogu u različitim disciplinama, među ostalim u. treba biti pažljivo odabran i izveden; (3) centrifugiranje, uobičajena metoda ispiranja u svim postupcima sekvencijske ekstrakcijske analize, može dovesti do krivih rezultata\n","Generated Summary: The study of 15 iron-rich minerals in an agricultural soil in an area of 1.2 rihydrites is conducted in the region of Schwertmann's Desert, a soil of a desert landscape near Schwertmann.The study was published in the Geological Journal of the Geological Association of the Geological Association.The study was published in the journal The Mining-Geology-Petroleum Engineering Bulletin (MEPB).The results show that the use of two different methods in the study of Fe (oxy)hydroxide in a soil and sediments are not consistent, but rather a mixture of several.The results show that the study can be a useful study in the study of the relationship between\n","abstract: Iron (oxy)hydroxides play an important role in a variety of disciplines, among others, environmental and exploration geochemistry, mineralogy, geology and soil science.In selective leaching procedures, either for the removal of (oxy)hydroxide prior to clay minerals analysis or for the determination of metals in reducible soil/sediment fractions, it is very important to preserve the entire undissolved residue.Therefore, the objectives of the study were: (1) to fi nd the most eff ective reagent rinsing method which follow the dissolution of (oxy)hydroxides; and (2) to test if the content of Fe (oxi) hydroxides could be determined gravimetrically.The following reagent rinsing methods were tested: (1) centrifugation, (2) fi ltration, (3) dialysis.The analysis was conducted on the sample of red soil with 5.12% Fe 2 O 3 .The time needed for rinsing increased in this order: centrifugation < fi ltration < dialysis.The amount of gravimetrically determined dissolved reducible fraction upon rinsing varies signifi cantly depending on the methods and it is remarkably higher than the amount of Fe 2 O 3 calculated from iron content determined by atomic absorption in leachate.The most eff ective reagent rinsing method which follows the dissolution of (oxy)hydroxides using dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate is dialysis.No loss of sample is the advantage of this method, but its disadvantage is time needed for its completion.Centrifugation is relatively rapid, but can lead to loss of the smaller particles.In this case the loss was unacceptably great.Filtration using fi lter paper is more time consuming than centrifugation and it showed the worst results.The conclusions are that: (1) the content of Fe (oxi)hydroxides cannot be determined gravimetrically upon selective leaching; (2) rinsing of reagents after Fe (oxi)hydroxide removal prior to clay mineral analysis should be carefully selected and performed; (3) centrifugation, accepted rinsing method in all sequential extraction sequences, can cause misleading results.\n","=============================\n","Full Text: Introduction  Research projects combining researchers from different disciplines are increasingly common-and increasingly sought after by funding agencies looking for ways to manage natural resources in ways that are environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable (see for example [1][2][3]).The management of coastal marine resources is a case in point, as fisheries, aquaculture, and coastal zone management have all embraced the ecosystem approach (at least theoretically).  Creating and running a truly integrated research project that combines very different disciplines is, however, no easy task.Large research projects tackling issues of sustainability have taken many years, a multitude of researchers and, sometimes, a substantial budget, with the explicit goal of transcending such boundaries and we still find genuine interdisciplinarity to be a substantial challenge [4].Researchers from such projects as the Earth Science Partnership (ESSP), the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and its outgrowth, the Program on Ecosystem Change and Society (PECS) have described these challenges [4][5][6].However, the meta-project of research integration should ideally take place on several levels.A more modestly-sized project such as CINTERA can build a taste for and experience with interdisciplinarity and even transdisciplinarity from the bottom up and on a smaller scale, offering insights into the integration process along the way.  This article is intended to share the methods, challenges and achievements experienced by a smaller group of researchers who struck out on their own to work together across disciplinary lines.As such it constitutes a case study as that called for by Nenseth et al. [7] and Harris & Lyon [3] and contributes to the compiling of narratives telling the story of interdisciplinary research as called for by Haapasaari et al. [2].The project \"A Cross-disciplinary Integrated Eco-system Eutrophication Research and Management Approach\" (CINTERA), funded by the Research Council of Norway (RCN, project 216607), compares conditions relating to marine eutrophication and its impacts close to a fjord in South Trøndelag in mid Norway and in two fjords in the Chilean Patagonia, and the adaptive capacity of local   The Task at Hand  The need for collaboration among researchers from many disciplines in order to achieve sustainability is now broadly recognized [3,[9][10][11][12].In the management of marine resources, such collaboration has in effect become policy: the ecosystem approach to management (EAM) has now been adopted in Norway [13], the European Union [14] and, in principle, the United States' federal marine management agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [15].The EAM not only requires a multi-sectoral approach to management-that is, the management of sectors such as fisheries, tourism, and shipping in an integrated way-but is also an approach that comprehends the human and natural components of the ecosystem as inextricably coupled (this is here termed the socio-ecological system (SES) approach) [16][17][18].The SES idea lies at the heart of work on climate change (the IPCC) (see for example [19]) and the Integrated Marine Biogeochemistry and Ecosystem Research (IMBER) initiated by the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme and the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research [20].  The resulting scientific and policy missions are accordingly highly complex and require a greatly expanded amount, spread, and integration of knowledge to realize.This means, first, that research must transcend the academic disciplines that have traditionally broken complex problems into smaller, more easily handled components: systems cannot be understood as merely the sum of their parts and are not readily managed by simple interventions that focus on a single factor.Research questions, designs, and methods that truly integrate the various disciplines must be devised.Finally, publically-funded projects are frequently problem and application-oriented and require solutions that take a wide variety of objectives and possible consequences into consideration depending on the stakeholder.These tasks require work that not only brings the work of many disciplines together but actually integrates them.  The CINTERA project addresses just the kind of issue that calls for collaborative work.Formally entitled \"A Cross-disciplinary Integrated Eco-system Eutrophication Research and Management Approach\", CINTERA explores the reaction of marine systems to eutrophication such as that which could result from aquaculture and the adaptive capacity of local communities should they be faced with the effects of eutrophication-effects such as the deterioration of their surrounding environment.The higher goal of the project is to contribute to better management of coastal zones in light of the eutrophication issue.CINTERA is very much a \"place-based\" project: it compares the effects of Atlantic salmon aquaculture in two coastal areas: in Trøndelag, Norway, and in two northern Patagonia fjords in Chile.  Eutrophication as used here relates to inputs into and the effects of organic and inorganic nutrients in aquatic systems [21].Inputs of mineral nutrients, primarily nitrogen and phosphorus, to specific waters increase the rate of supply of organic matter to an ecosystem, enhancing primary production [22].Consequently, eutrophication deals with both the process of nutrient input and its associated effects.Inputs may be of both natural and \"cultural\" origins [23].Aquaculture is one of many cultural sources of eutrophication (via the feeding of fish and resulting excretion), but there are many others; run-off from agricultural land, discharges into the water system from factories, and households and atmospheric depositions originating from a variety of human activities are significant sources of nitrogen and phosphates [24].While it is usually the nutrient inputs of cultural origin that draw the attention of researchers [21], there are also significant natural sources, which vary significantly by water system.This in turn means that the effects produced by the cultural addition of nutrients to an aquatic system will vary by system.Because experiences with the introduction of, for example, aquaculture will accordingly vary by location [23,24], impacts on human communities and stakeholder awareness of the potential for eutrophication and its associated effects will also vary.  The major impacts of eutrophication can be changes in the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems (potentially resulting in algae blooms), reduced biodiversity, and degraded water quality, including reduced oxygen levels.These effects may in turn lead to reduced income from fisheries, mariculture, tourism, and the poisoning of animals and people by algal toxins [24].Eutrophication can, then, potentially have a significant impact on both human livelihoods and health.  Understanding the potential impact on humans of eutrophication requires understanding among other things, the likelihood that eutrophication will occur in a given area, how extensive it may be (exposure), and the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of local communities with respect to the associated effects of eutrophication.Policy-makers need to be aware of the potential for, the potential effects of, and stakeholder concerns regarding eutrophication if they are to prevent or limit its harmful effects: the CINTERA project seeks to understand the exposure and sensitivity of local marine ecosystems on the one hand, the adaptive capacity of local communities on the other and ultimately, to assist decision-makers in the management process.  One of the new ventures launched in the 1980s that was designed to draw Chile out of its economic difficulties, salmonid aquaculture (the farming of Atlantic salmon and related species) developed into a major industry [25][26][27].In its first, highly dynamic phase, the industry was centered in the Los Lagos Region (Region X) of the country.It became an important employer in a depressed region and produced a critical export product.Chile soon came to be the second largest producer of the species (after Norway).The outbreak in 2007 of Infectious Salmon Anemia (ISA), a highly contagious viral disease that requires the destruction of all fish at the infected site, was a disaster for the industry and for the people reliant upon it for jobs.The importance of understanding the potential for eutrophication and its possible impacts with respect to current aquaculture areas is underscored by the dramatic social impact of the collapse of the industry in 2007.The industry has recovered significantly since then, but is now eager to move further south, to new areas (Coyhaique and Magallanes regions) untouched by the troublesome disease.The proposed movement of the industry into relatively pristine areas is of concern because of the paucity of scientific information about these areas.Monitoring the impact of aquaculture will not be possible without good knowledge of the baselines against which change could be measured.  Understanding the potential for and potential impact of eutrophication requires just the sort of close work that sustainability projects demand.How has CINTERA tackled the challenge of integrated and collaborative research and has it succeeded?   Integrated Research and CINTERA  Just what is integrative and collaborative research?The jumble of words with finely shaded meanings that have been used to refer to collaborative work testifies to just how difficult it is to describe and prescribe what has, can, and should be done.Despite the title of the CINTERA project (\"A Cross-Disciplinary ... Approach\"), a review [2][3][4][5]7,12,[28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36] of the growing literature on building collaborative projects that transcend academic disciplines reveals that the term \"cross-disciplinary\" is not much used and is, at best, vaguely defined (For example, Nenseth et al. 2010 [7] define \"cross-disciplinary\" as the borrowing of methods and perspectives by one discipline by another).As it turned out, this term actually fit our project as it was originally conceived, having as it did the goal of bringing together some very different disciplines but leaving the nature of the collaboration a bit open and underspecified.  To bring the necessary precision to the discussion of CINTERA's collaborative work, we discuss the project using the terminology offered by Stock and Burton's review of the literature [12] (pp.1095-1101), [28] (p.24).Their work suggests that a rough consensus is emerging to designate projects with varying ranges of integration as \"multidisciplinary\", \"interdisciplinary\", or \"transdisciplinary\" [28][29][30][31][32][33].Multidisciplinary projects have the least degree of integration; they are essentially a set of separate projects gathered under a single project theme but with only some dialogue among the various components at best, perhaps towards the end of the project.\"Interdisciplinary\" projects have a higher degree of integration: representatives of several disciplines come together to formulate the problem and agree upon a methodological framework.  Interdisciplinary research is furthermore broken down into \"small\" and \"large\" varieties: the small version is the transcendence of boundaries between supposedly closely-related disciplines-say within the natural sciences-and the \"large\" version takes place across only distantly-related disciplines (classically across the social-natural science divide).This terminology is not meant to trivialize the challenges that researchers in either the natural or social sciences may face in working with their supposedly closely-related kin: even sub-disciplines within a given academic discipline may not communicate or work well with each other.The terminology does reflect the view popular within the sustainability field that the combined social-natural science work, required to understand the coupling of the socio-ecological system [28,34], is more difficult and elusive still [4,28].  Transdisciplinary research is a different level of integration altogether.Considered the \"holy grail\" of sustainability research, transdisciplinary work crosses not just disciplinary boundaries but also the divide between academic and non-academic participants [7,9], [12] (p.1102).  The CINTERA project had its origins in the intellectual curiosity of researchers of various disciplinary backgrounds and represents their first attempt at putting such a varied group together.CINTERA researchers did not approach their project as an exercise in the grand goal of interdisciplinarity as described in the sustainability literature.In its origins and its structure, the project therefore did not accord with the best advice of the sustainability advocates: much of its work is best classified as multidisciplinary because it consists of researchers with varying backgrounds working side-by-side on the same theme rather than working closely together on the same problem [28] (p.24).CINTERA has, however, elements of both small and large interdisciplinarity and is propelling the participants towards more integrative work, both within the CINTERA project and beyond.A project such as CINTERA can serve as a team-building exercise, forging the experience, knowledge, and trust required for more ambitious projects much in the fashion described in [3].The CINTERA project supports the general point made in the literature that problem-orientation and policy aspects can drive a project to develop an interdisciplinary character [7,33,34,36].The evolution of the CINTERA project was also fired in turn by the ambition of the researchers to make a real contribution to their communities.  CINTERA is a project of modest size but relatively great diversity.The eight principal researchers represent five different nationalities (Norwegian, Chilean, Colombian, Kurdish, and North-American), six different academic disciplines (depending on how you count-political science, economics, marine biology/oceanography, and marine biogeochemistry), five different research institutions, and two different departments within one of the latter.It is roughly equally split with respect to gender: four of seven of the core team are men.The project accordingly has potential cultural divisions along national, institutional, linguistic, gender, career achievements and disciplinary lines.This paper focuses on the issues arising from knitting together the various disciplines represented.As far as we can tell, this is the most relevant cleavage within the group, and it cuts across the potential divisions of nationality, institution, and gender.   CINTERA's Integrative Vantage Point  Reports on experiences in trying to create truly interdisciplinary projects highlight the importance of the very first stages in the formulation of a research project.How the research question is framed and the choice of methodology are essential [4,34].This is the mark of the truly interdisciplinary project: the integration of theoretical frameworks, models, and methodology and the statement of the problem in a discipline-neutral way [2][3][4]30].As researchers in the Global Environmental Change and Food Systems (CECAFS) project, put it, \"you can't just 'bolt on' social science\" [4] to research frameworks anchored firmly in natural science disciplines.Similarly, it doesn't work to \"bolt\" natural science work on to research frameworks assembled on the social science side, either.CINTERA's origins were not neutral, but the project shows that useful interdisciplinary work may yet emerge from such a beginning.It was the natural science team that initiated the project, looking in part to further the research methods and results [8] from a previous project in Norway and Chile (WAFOW, noted above).  The origins of the project meant, first of all that of all issues pertaining to aquaculture, the project would focus on eutrophication.It was this topic that the natural science team had focused on in their earlier project and hoped to continue to work on.The natural science team therefore had a sense of ownership of the project.Secondly, it meant that each team developed its own set of methods and research questions-a situation that does not necessarily bode particularly well for interdisciplinary research.However, project participants approached the project with the explicit intention of working together.That meant that both teams also contributed to and reviewed the third, integrative, work package as well as the overall project description and formulation of project goals.This process resulted in a project with two work packages with specific, separate goals but also a third work package that was explicitly designed to address joint, policy-relevant goals (useful indicators and improving management) where genuine interdisciplinary work was to take place.  Two of CINTERA's three work packages can accordingly be seen as multidisciplinary, a kind of \"parallel play\", in which the two teams worked side by side rather than together.The natural scientists had their cruises and the social scientists held their workshops, each team independent of the other.However, each of these two work packages can also be seen as an example of small interdisciplinarity.While \"large\" interdisciplinarity may be the more glamorous goal, the CINTERA project demonstrates the importance of this so-called \"small\" version.The study of eutrophication requires understanding the pollution aspect within the complex coastal marine ecosystem with respect to its physical (such as currents, water exchange rate, and the stability of pycnoclines), chemical (such as macro and micro nutrients and oxygen distribution in the water column) and biological (such as bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton community structure distribution and functional roles) variables.With respect to aspects of social and economic sustainability, the impact of the differing social, economic, and political contexts of aquaculture management in Chile and Norway equally clearly confirms the need for \"small\" interdisciplinarity in understanding these.  As noted above, CINTERA's ambition to bridge the natural-social science divide and transcend \"parallel play\", lay behind the creation of its third work package.Building such a work package explicitly into a project of even modest size speaks to the recognized need for a forum specifically dedicated to bridging project divides [7].CINTERA's interdisciplinary forum was what it called \"consilience\" workshops (The term \"consilience\" is here used with the positive intension of according equal value to both sides of social-natural science divide.It is not an embrace of the \"reductionist\" view in which social sciences and the humanities are seen as mere adjuncts to natural science, a view championed by E. O. Wilson in his book 1998 book, Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge.For a discussion of this issue, see the review of Wilson in [37]).In these workshops, held on a regular basis throughout the three years of the project, each team presented its work to the plenum and worked together on the project's integrative goals.As written, however, the way integration would be achieved was not specified.We were quite certain that once the project was underway we would develop a deeper understanding of each other's work, the demands of that work, the policy relevance of the work being done and the importance of improving our ability to communicate our findings beyond our immediate circles to the broader world of policy makers and stakeholders.  Finally, the CINTERA project recognized the importance of stakeholder views from the outset.CINTERA researchers planned to investigate how stakeholder concerns matched up with those of the natural scientists.In this way, the CINTERA project spoke to the concerns of transdisciplinary research, but, because stakeholders were not involved in the creation of the project, it did not achieve true transdisciplinary status.   Practical Issues in Application Writing  The actual writing of a project application is always an exercise that forces the research team to recognize and deal with issues relating to research question and design.The writing of a multi-or interdisciplinary application may present particular difficulties.At the same time, the effort to tackle these difficulties, however, can also be a driver of integration.  Creating a project that stands some chance of developing in an interdisciplinary direction requires attention to case selection.This is tricky because what a \"case\" may mean varies tremendously, even within a single discipline (see for example the discussion of this with respect to Political Science in [38]).CINTERA's case-selection was driven by the needs of the natural science team: their research plan, focused on variables relevant to the natural science questions, drove their selection of sampling sites.These sites constitute a set of cases relevant to the study of the natural conditions that impact eutrophication.In order to link the two sides of the project, the social science team selected communities in the vicinity of the research sites chosen by the natural science team.Because the natural science team related the eutrophication issue to aquaculture, and targeted areas close to important population areas, this pairing happened to work.CINTERA's Chilean social science work focused on communities where aquaculture is now a major industry (in the Puerto Montt region) or where it would like to move (Magallanes region); in Norway it focused on Frøya and Hitra (in county of South Trøndelag in mid Norway) where aquaculture is a major industry.Selecting communities in the vicinity of key aquaculture areas enhanced the possibility that research of direct relevance to stakeholders would be done.  But while CINTERA's work has been fruitful, case selection that is not driven by a mutually-framed research question carries real risk.Social scientific work cannot produce generalizable results (an admittedly controversial goal [39]) if cases are selected according to a research agenda that targets variables irrelevant to its theory regarding, for example, a community's adaptive capacity; natural science is unlikely to prosper if the work is driven exclusively by social science concerns.If the criteria for case selection differ too radically, and the two \"teams\" cannot find a meeting place in what they study, a truly collaborative project is unlikely to develop.Indeed, they will have little to say to each other.A minimum requirement is that both teams chose cases that in some way contribute to the common project.  On a less abstract, more practical level, the project descriptions that routinely accompany applications to funding agencies are exercises in writing concisely and coherently.It is always difficult to boil down theoretical and empirical work to a few highly-focused pages that cover the research question, the state of the art and the contribution the project proposes to make.Writing an application for a multi-disciplinary project, however, can present a special challenge.The application must cover several literatures from several fields, employing enough of the specialized language particular to each to convince readers of the applicant's thorough knowledge of the field.At the same time, the parts must be woven into a whole and presented in such a way that the work is readily understandable to potential evaluators from a variety of disciplines.Depending on the funding agency, the integrative research project can present a challenge in finding competent evaluators.In addition, while many funding agencies urge collaborative work there are few clear gatekeepers or standards [28,36], [34] (p.389).Balancing the need for specialized language against the need to make the project comprehensible to a broader audience is difficult and takes practice.One way to accomplish this is for both teams to read and critique the entire application, with each pointing out obscure passages, opaque jargon, and unspoken assumptions to the others.Finding the right balance between informed precision and general accessibility will not only pay off in effective communication to the evaluator, but the exercise can also help project researchers understand each other better.  Communication among different disciplines can be a barrier to creating an interdisciplinary project [2].Finding common language and reference points is useful in the process.A useful metaphor served to knit the two aspects of the CINTERA project together.The natural science team provided the information that \"a salmon cage aquaculture system (CAS) producing 1000 tons of fish a year generates an amount of nutrient waste comparable to a community of approximately 10,000 people\" [40,41].This language made it easy for the social science team to relate to the potential significance of introducing an aquaculture facility of such a size to the target coastal areas and served as a the gateway for natural science explanations about what effects the additional nutrient waste might have.Within the structure of the project, it provided a vantage point for exploring stakeholder concerns about aquaculture.This comparison also served to highlight the policy implications of the research proposed.However, it also led to some confusion between the two teams, as described below.  The common part of the application focused on the need for the project and presented the big picture as to how it all fit together.Much of the most discipline-specific information was reserved for the appropriate work package description.This allowed the researcher to go beyond the general, accessible language of the introduction and speak to the appropriate referee.The natural science team provided much more specialized knowledge about which nutrients would be studied, the potential impact of these on the plankton of the fjord, and they explained their research design.The social science team could explain the concept of the stakeholder workshops and the methods used-the Systems Thinking (ST), Conceptual Probability Tables (CPT), and Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) methods [42] as well as how their case selection corresponded to the natural science side.Each work package spoke clearly to how the work related to the central research question.  Budgets are always contentious issues, as every political scientist knows (the authoritative division of resources within a community is the essence of politics).Here is a potential source of unhappiness in this kind of collaborative project, since the natural science team tends to require relatively large sums for its basic research and potential funding is always limited.In the case of CINTERA, while the social team needed funding for travel, meeting localities and conferences and congresses, the natural scientists not only needed these budget items but also research vessel rental, purchase or rental of sophisticated technology for sampling and analysis of samples, the purchase of expensive chemicals and the transport of samples.Such expenses are hardly luxuries for the natural science team but can lead to a budget that looks disproportionate in favor of the natural science team.In a world in which budget share can be a measure of the importance accorded a given task, this can create a sense of frustration within the research group.The antidote to this is for everybody to understand going in that this sort of research simply can not be done without this basic funding: leaving budget details to the closing phase may result in sticker shock for the social science team.  The writing of an interdisciplinary application also brings up administrative and other issues that can impact the project down the road.Who should be the leader of such a collaborative project?Can the project leader exercise the necessary quality control over the whole of the project?What institution will host it?While these questions are common to most research applications, they may be more difficult to resolve for institutions that are not used to working with each other and which may have very different research and administrative cultures.Finding a solution for these using a short-term, problem-solving perspective is sometimes required, but researchers should not be naïve: while researchers are often mostly concerned with getting on with their work, these decisions have real consequences, matter quite a bit in some quarters and can complicate the future administration of the project.   Getting Started: \"Chicken-Chicken\" and \"The Kindergarten Approach\"  When great ideas have to be put into effect, the really hard work starts.The kick-off meeting is important in setting the tone for the work to come.  CINTERA's origins in a natural science project were clear in its kickoff meeting, which followed directly upon the heels of the concluding meeting of its all-natural-science predecessor.In a minor way, this development mirrors a common pattern in sustainability research, which often starts with what have been called the \"environmental\" sciences to which social science is later introduced (see for example, the IMBER program) [20].  Once the kickoff meeting began, CINTERA project members became aware of just how large the gulf separating the two teams actually was.As the natural scientists presented their work on the impacts of nutrients from aquaculture on coastal systems using terms such as CNLR, NH4, PON, DOC, and POC (critical nutrient loading rate, ammonium, particulate organic nitrogen, dissolved and particulate organic carbon).The social scientists struggled to follow the conversation.These terms were as obscure to the social science team as the concepts of stakeholder workshops run using ST, CPT, and BBN (Systems Thinking, Conditional Probability Tables and Bayesian Belief Networks) techniques were to the natural science team.The economist's approach to exploring trade-offs among stakeholders using terms like \"Pareto optimality\" was baffling to the natural science team-and some of the social science team.For each non-specialist, presentations seemed much like Doug Zongker's [43] humorous \"chicken-chicken\" paper and subsequent presentation to the AAAS humor session in 2007: presentations in recognizable form and style but utterly incomprehensible in content.  The major challenge at such an interdisciplinary workshop is then to present work that is useful to the specialist while being accessible to someone who is highly educated-but in another field.This requires that the presenting specialist take a step back and get back to basics-including definitions and assumptions-and that those with other specialties be open to what essentially amounts to learning a new language.In handling the constant stress that the effort to explain \"the obvious\" can produce, humor can be a useful tool.The CINTERA participants revised their presentations to pitch the information at a more basic level.We collectively came to call this-with fondness and respect-\"the kindergarten approach\".Presentations that seemed particularly impenetrable to one group or another brought on mumblings of \"chicken, chicken, chicken…\".  At the consilience workshops, CINTERA researchers strove to speak in such a way that all could follow.This proved to be difficult to sustain over time.It is after all hard to explain \"everything\" all the time.In addition, it is easy to offend someone unintentionally.The off-hand remark about something being \"obvious\" can ruffle a feather or two while the need to explain \"the obvious\" can be frustrating.Personal trust is critical in keeping tempers in check and participants on speaking terms [3].On the whole, however, the pressure to make ourselves comprehensible to each other has served us well, since it is also a funding agency demand that we make our work assessable to both policy makers and the general public (an increasingly important part of a publically-funded project).The project as a whole is furthermore helped immensely by the personalities that participate in it.Having the right team of researchers is essential [3,36]; having an open mind and the willingness to work at communication are highly useful characteristics for the researcher engaged in interdisciplinary work.For example, our marine-biogeochemist has a passion to explain his work to those outside his field and our economist has the eternal patience of a teacher used to explaining the basics of his work to the uninitiated.  But despite the best efforts of all, there continued to be layers of miscommunication.The metaphor cited above about the potential impact of salmon cage aquaculture was helpful for the social scientists to grasp and communicate the policy implications of the natural science side of the study, but initially hindered the understanding on the part of social scientists as to the role aquaculture was thought to play in the relevant systems.The research areas-the coastal areas surrounding the islands of Hitra and Frøya in Norway and the Reloncaví Fjord in the Los Lagos region of Chile-have strikingly different characteristics (see Figure 1 for an illustration of some of these differences).While it is in any case a mistake to extrapolate from general, laboratory findings to the effect that the addition of nutrients might have in a natural setting; it is even more problematic to extrapolate from these to different natural settings.This may be crystal clear to the relevant specialist, but the significance of the differences may not be immediately apparent to someone outside that field.Ironically, social scientists frequently argue in their own work that (socio-economic-political-cultural) context matters and that you can not necessarily extrapolate from a single case, but here didn't immediately grasp that this is also the case for sea water-even if it became obvious with a little thought.  The metaphor also proved misleading about the degree to which the natural science team was prepared to extrapolate from the findings resulting from their samples to making statements about the larger systems from which the samples were taken.The general reluctance of the natural science team to extract the policy relevance of the findings from their samples emerged for the first time during the kickoff meeting.That realization demonstrated the usefulness of the consilience platform of the project but also the lesson that metaphors and illustrations must be chosen and used with care.   Figure 1.  Comparing fjord systems in Chile and Norway.Water chemistry, geography, and the structure of planktonic communities vary between the two, resulting in different impacts (pollution or dispersion) when nutrients such as silicate, phosphorous, and nitrogen concentrations are altered.Therefore as a result of the change of nutrient concentration the structure of the phytoplanktonic communities of a system can be significantly changed (see [8]).   Building Integration  The first stage of work on the CINTERA project was largely multidisciplinary although \"small\" interdisciplinarity work took place on each side of the natural-social science divide.Each team focused for the most part on its component projects: understanding the impacts of nutrients on planktonic communities and identifying the concerns of stakeholders given the scenario of a ten-fold increase in aquaculture.The next step was the big challenge: \"large\" interdisciplinary work.  As others suggest [6] (p. 1305), [12] (p.1096), [44], [45] (p.376), it is precisely problem-specific and policy orientations that can provide a major impetus behind genuinely interdisciplinary work.As noted, the CINTERA project always had a real commitment to addressing policy questions.While the CINTERA project was initiated by the natural science team, which had very clear ideas about the scientific work that project would do, that team nonetheless had a bit of an activist disposition.It often expressed the meaning of CINTERA's work in relationship to a larger, policy context.Concern for conditions in Chile was particularly acute, although salmon aquaculture is significant in both Chile and Norway.The natural science team was very much aware of the history of the Atlantic salmon industry in Chile and the attempt of the industry to move to new areas.The CINTERA project was accordingly formulated with the goal of contributing to management: finding indicators that are \"useful to managers,\" helping to achieve of Good Environmental Status (an EU policy goal specifically relevant in the Norwegian context but which could serve as a useful goal or measure in the Chilean context) and anticipating the adaptive capacity of communities.  The policy part of CINTERA's work package three was, specifically, to \"bring all of the participants together to coordinate efforts and exchange ideas and input for the construction of indicators and management tools.\"These policy-relevant ambitions, in turn, required real interdisciplinary work.As noted above, however, how this was to happen was underspecified.The lack of specificity in the application had the advantage of allowing flexibility in addressing policy issues, but the disadvantage of not acknowledging and addressing the real differences between the two teams as to how to do this.This meant that these real differences in approach emerged only in the closing phases.We can take some solace in the observations of Balsiger [33] and Oughton & Bracken [34] that this lack of specificity is common to projects such as ours, but that this openness can maximize the flexibility that researchers can have in addressing such tasks.  It became clear that finding a reliable indicator of eutrophication would be difficult.There may be no single, reliable, and straightforward metric.We also realized that finding such an indicator might not be enough.To be truly \"useful to managers,\" indicators would have to be cost efficient and easily understandable.More information is needed about the management system and to whom indicators should be targeted.Here is an area where the combined CINTERA team could truly work together, and was the focus of joint effort towards the end of the CINTERA project.Our work however, revealed very different views about how to approach this work.This divide was also apparent in our preliminary discussions about crafting a research application to follow CINTERA.Attempting to address policy relevance more directly from the outset is very difficult.As a broad generalization, the social science team tended to press for firm statements about what the proposed research will tell policy makers, while the natural science team remained very reluctant to scale up the findings of their samplings and analyses to general statements about the local ecosystem and focused on the needs of basic science.It is one thing to evoke the spirit of policy relevance, it is quite another to link basic research directly to the achievement of policy goals.  At this point the potential value of transdisciplinary work became apparent.While the two teams were focused on difficulties of making the work they were doing policy relevant, the workshops of the social science team made it very clear that management issues regarding aquaculture transcend the danger represented by eutrophication.Given the origins of the project, social scientists approached stakeholders with the issue of the dangers of eutrophication that increased aquaculture might bring foremost in their thinking.Stakeholders in both Norway and Chile, however, had quite different issues foremost in their minds.  Happily, the workshop methodologies used by the social science team are designed to elicit stakeholder concerns, rather than to tell them what these should be.The most relevant methodology in this context is Systems Thinking (ST), a group-level discussion methodology designed to distill a common understanding of how a socio-ecological system works from the various perspectives of the participants.Figure 2 illustrates the process of distilling the shared conceptual map at a workshop in Chile run by Dr. Hugo Salgado.Participants are posed a question or are asked to imagine a specific situation and are then invited to explore how they would be affected or what they would do in that situation.While researchers start off the discussion by specifying a set of systemic \"drivers\" prepared in advance by experts, this simply gives the discussion a starting point.The workshop leader poses some questions based on the initially specified drivers but then follows the lead of the workshop participants.The experience of those running the workshops is that stakeholders feel quite free to take the discussion in the directions they think it should go, adding their own drivers to the mix of those provided at the outset or simply taking the discussion in an unanticipated direction.In Chile it became rapidly apparent that many stakeholders were most concerned with the lack of the ability of the Chilean state to monitor and enforce its own management measures.Norwegians, living in a country where confidence in state institutions is much higher as a rule, were concerned more about the social issues that an increase in aquaculture would likely bring: the need for labor has already resulted in a large influx of foreign labor, posing challenges for local communities.More aquaculture is likely to bring greater challenges.In these cases, then, there were poor matches between the concerns of key experts and those of local stakeholders [46,47].  This point brings us back (again) to the issue of the policy relevance of the CINTERA project, the key driver of its emergent interdisciplinary quality.Eutrophication and its effects are a key issue for our group of natural scientists, but this issue was not on the radar screens of stakeholders.It was also not on the radar screens of the social scientists who routinely work with aquaculture questions.Indeed, after viewing a report on the CINTERA project, a senior Norwegian official external to the project asked informally why we had chosen to focus on eutrophication.In his experience, stakeholders have many concerns about aquaculture but eutrophication barely registers (if at all).The short answer to this was of course, because natural scientists who do see eutrophication as a key issue invited the social science team to participate in their project.The longer answer is that natural scientists had identified a gap in knowledge they considered essential.In Chile, the history of the aquaculture industry, its current attempt to move into areas almost untouched by industry and the lack of fundamental knowledge about coastal ecosystems make this work urgent [48,49].Even so, and as fruitful and rewarding as the resulting project collaboration has been, the focus on eutrophication is seen by some outside the project as peripheral to more pressing stakeholder concerns.This means that taking the project in a policy-relevant direction is a bigger challenge than anticipated.  This point was driven home again in an informative seminar the CINTERA project held in Puerto Montt, Chile.The goal of the seminar was to share the project's work with researchers.While information on eutrophication was presented, stakeholders did not seem to absorb its significance.They were more interested in hearing about what Chilean stakeholders in other workshops had to say, comparing their own views with those of others.Chileans were also particularly eager to hear about conditions in Norway.  The take-home point is that stakeholders (including decision-makers) have a variety of concerns and decision-makers have to respond to these; both groups also have to prioritize the use of resources.This means that the policy relevance of research on eutrophication must be explained not just with respect to its scientific importance but also with respect to how it relates to other pressing issues related to salmon aquaculture.There remains a clear and not entirely resolvable tension between the need for good basic science on the one hand and the need for science that can be immediately and explicitly \"used\" by policy makers.   Methodology as a Bridge over the Large Divide  One of the more interesting aspects of working with the cross-disciplinary group is the number of concepts that many of us in fact do have in common, and where our disciplinary differences are bridged.Burton, Rønningen, and Wedderburn [28] make an important point about the differences in ontology and epistemology in the natural and social sciences when they underscore the importance of the \"interpretive turn\" in social sciences.By this they are referring to the broad rejection by key groups within the social sciences of \"positivism\" and the idea of the \"scientific\" study of social phenomena.However, they underplay the potential usefulness of the positivist legacy that remains.A good grounding in positivism and its methodologies is important in social sciences because it provides an important set of concepts and tools for analyzing the empirical claims made every day in the world of politics and policy and because it allows for real understanding of the meaning of the interpretivist turn within social science disciplines.But it has an additional benefit: it can also help the social scientist bridge the gap to natural science.The scientific method can provide a common language for us all even when the content varies.Commonalities come from those aspects of social and natural science work that grapple with establishing causality, including concepts such as variable analysis, control groups, reference points, and sample selection criteria.In addition, the basic ideas about \"systems\" are nearly universally understood.Social science shares with biology the concepts of evolution and adaption-whence these concepts came.This does not mean that the participating social scientist must necessarily adopt a positivistic, or what Moses and Knutsen [39] term a \"naturalist,\" perspective.It does mean that this common language can serve as a bridge among disciplines and knowledge of it, if only to explain differences in thinking.  The notion that fluency in the language and terminology of positivist or naturalist science can help bridge disciplinary gaps should not be interpreted to mean this will resolve communication problems, only that it can help.Differences in language use among the disciplines are frequently pointed to as creating problems for the collaborative effort [2,3,10,44].The CINTERA experience confirms this.Some of the language differences were quite obvious: researchers were acutely aware when they failed to grasp the meaning of chemical abbreviations or workshop methodologies.But the borrowing of terms across disciplinary lines can create confusion too, since the same words can be applied in very different ways.In CINTERA, our biologists (and our bio-geo-chemist!)are very concerned about the structure and function of communities just as is the social science team-but it turned out that while the social scientists were preoccupied with human communities, our biologists were talking about planktonic communities.Here is an instance, by the way, in which awareness of the history of the development of the social sciences, specifically that of the heyday of social science structural functionalism, came in handy.The long but now largely out of date tradition of social science structural functionalism sought to transcend western biases by examining societies as composed of social, cultural, and political systems with associated, abstract structures and functions related to the stability of the system.This tradition proved useful to the social scientists, equipping them with the concepts and terminology to grasp the approach taken by the biologists (and the biogeochemist).   Conclusions  Research projects that stretch across disciplinary boundaries come in many varieties.Not every project has to achieve the high degree of integration embodied by the increasingly accepted term \"interdisciplinary\".Moreover, projects can usefully combine both multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary aspects: not every bit of the work done need be integrated, or perhaps better said, equally integrated, nor should the value of \"small\" interdisciplinarity be underestimated.It is clear that ultimately tackling sustainability will, however, require work that is genuinely integrative, based on theoretical frameworks and methodologies that span and unite disciplines and which generate new knowledge.But even small but genuine steps in the direction of interdisciplinarity can have longer-term pay offs as researchers learn to collaborate and to appreciate the need for true integration.  CINTERA experiences largely confirm many of the points made in the literature on interdisciplinarity. \"Large\" interdisciplinarity was the larger challenge in the CINTERA project.The social science team and the natural science team worked smoothly in the \"small\" interdisciplinary aspects of the project.Communication issues did present real difficulties, despite the real work that went into building bridges between the two different teams at the application writing stage.CINTERA's experiences suggest, however, that communication issues are seldom resolved at a single clarifying moment; the experience is more like peeling back layers on an onion.A good grounding in the language of \"positivist\" science can help in this process of building good communication.  The CINTERA project illustrates that it is indeed questions related to policy that constitute the most direct stimulant to interdisciplinarity.As noted above, it was CINTERA's explicitly policy-oriented aspect, the need to find indicators and assist management, that prompted the two teams to engage most directly with each other.Finding indicators that are useful for decision-makers is only partially a question of natural science-it is also a question of cost-effectiveness, regulatory requirements, and ease of use.This is a task that must be achieved as a team.However, it may be more surprising, perhaps, that the integrating effect of the policy aspect runs throughout the entire project and is not only confined to tasks that are specifically designated as the \"interdisciplinary part.\"This urge emerged spontaneously as the two teams struggled to find common ground from the first day of the project.  The CINTERA project provides a good illustration of how interdisciplinarity began to emerge and the value it can have.Getting real insight into why changes in nutrient levels can have a dramatic impact on planktonic communities-and why that matters-has been invaluable for the social science team, helping them to frame their work on the human communities in question.Focusing on a single question (here eutrophication) has allowed social science researchers to improve their basic knowledge about the relevant natural systems.This is useful because while social scientists tend to appreciate the importance of social, cultural, political institutional contexts of policy, they may easily overlook the ways that differences in natural conditions can impact the success of policy measures.The WAFOW and CINTERA work has very clearly shown that one fjord is not pretty much the same as another [8], suggesting that emissions from aquaculture (and regulations) will have different consequences (and create different challenges) for each.Finally, the credibility of social scientists in the context of policy making or when interacting with stakeholders, managers, and natural scientists, is increased when they have a good grasp of the environmental issues to which they apply their own expertise.Real interaction with the natural science team helps the social science team to ask the right questions and pursue issues to which they might not have otherwise paid attention.  Natural scientists, similarly, can use assistance in answering the question \"so what?\"Here, the social science team can play a role in helping to translate the highly specialized work of, for example, a biologist/oceanographer or the marine bio-geo-chemist into information about what this work means for the community at large.In the CINTERA project, some of the natural scientists report the good feeling they have in knowing that the research they are doing can potentially contribute to the improving the quality of life of fishermen and aquaculture workers, even if it is, in the words of one of our researchers, just by a \"grain of sand\".Understanding the socio-political context into which their information will be released can be helpful in helping them understand the impact their current work may have or how they might make a bigger or more directly relevant contribution to the community.After all, human communities are as varied and complex as planktonic communities: varying socio-political and economic structures mean that they too react differently to any given stimulant and or event-just as planktonic communities do.In addition, such structures have their own resilience: simply obtaining and presenting good information is unlikely to change the attitudes and behaviors of the key actors in the system.A related point is that even the best scientific research cannot be adequately used if the state lacks the capacity to formulate, implement, and enforce regulations.Similarly, if stakeholders lack confidence in the aquaculture industry and the regulatory authorities they are unlikely to concern themselves with the intricacies of the scientific work.Finally, the social science side can help the natural science side know and speak to environmental questions with which the community is concerned, even if the natural science team finds these concerns to be misplaced or trivial.  It is clear that while good basic work needs to be done by each team, neither should work in too much in isolation from the other, even if a \"consilience\" platform is built into the project and intentions are good.Each team needs to have a real appreciation of the relevance to their own work of the other team's expertise.For example, social scientists need to understand the reasons why the natural science team might be reluctant to extrapolate from the results of their work.Similarly, a natural science team could profit by appreciating why social scientists might press for policy relevance or how stakeholder perceptions can impact both natural systems (by affecting human behavior that provides inputs to that system) and, ultimately, the work of the natural scientists (by affecting funding).While regularly scheduled joint discussions are invaluable, cross-participation in the so-called small interdisciplinary parts of the project could well serve to bridge these gaps.  The stakeholder workshops hold lessons of their own that relate both the interdisciplinarity and, less discussed here, transdisciplinarity.With respect to the first, the effort to share the scientific work on eutrophication with the stakeholders suggests that the natural scientists may have an important role in communicating critical information to stakeholders, alerting them to problems that are not highly visible or immediately threatening.Taking on such a role, however, will require real work in learning how to present the information to a general audience in such a way that is it readily understood and its significance properly appreciated.Researchers must be careful to neither needlessly frighten stakeholders nor leave them with a false sense of security.Social scientists might help with that.With respect to transdisciplinarity, the project as a whole would have profited by involving stakeholders at an early stage.This would have helped project researchers understand the position of eutrophication in the hierarchy of stakeholder concerns, allowing them to formulate their work in ways more directly useful to those stakeholders.  The CINTERA project has played an important role both in terms of the research done (and has yet to do) and in educating individual researchers in the joys and challenges of collaborating across disciplines.Tackling the challenges at this level prepares us for the bigger challenges that research on ICZM, fisheries, and aquaculture management or Climate Change have in store for us.member of the Chilean team have been active in discussing the policy implications of the project, providing material and insights for this aspect of the article.He has participated in the group discussions that helped produce the article.José Luis Iriarte reviewed the manuscript and made substantive comments on the science and policy aspects of this manuscript.He has participated in the group discussions that helped produce the article.Lasse Mork Olsen also reviewed the article in several versions, and has provided substantive editorial input and valuable insights throughout.He created Figure 1.He has participated in the group discussions that helped produce the article.Klaudia L.

In patients with epilepsy, depression occurs in about 30%, anxiety disorders in 10-25%, and psychosis in 2-7%. 1 Thus, these patients are more likely to have psychiatric diseases, 2 and are more than three times as likely to commit suicide as the general population. 2,3 About 5% of the adolescents in the community have Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and another 3.3% have dysthymia. 3 Evidence showed that MDD is associated with smaller hippocampal volumes. 4-6 A previous study found that subjects with depression and a history of childhood abuse had an 18% smaller mean left hippocampal volume than those never abused, and a 15% decrease in comparison with healthy subjects. 7 In identifying teenagers with suicidal tendencies, factors such as a family history of suicide, alcohol and drug abuse, previous  symptoms of epilepsy, hallucinations, and episodic memory loss improved and resolved the epileptic waves on EEG, but her depression symptoms became aggravated. Suicidal and homicidal ideations toward her family and schoolmates continued. She showed personality changes such as becoming impatient and isolating herself extremely from peers. In October 2013, although she had psychological counseling for depression, symptoms of repeated self-injurious behaviors and suicidal and homicidal ideations were not improved. In January 2013, neurologists treated her with lamotrigine (up to 200 mg), but her symptoms did not improve. In August 2013, she was admitted for further evaluation and treatment.  Upon admission, clinical history taking revealed that she had suffered from chronic bullying and victimization from same-sex peers, and had been sexually abuse, twice, by an adult male from her neighborhood when she was 10 years old. On mental state examination (MSE), she endorsed present suicidal and homicidal ideation, depressed mood, repeated nightmares, and flashbacks about bullying or sexual abuse. Routine blood tests, including complete blood count, serum electrolyte, creatinine, glucose, and vitamin B12, vitamin E, and folate, autoimmune serologies, and electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, and EEG showed no aberrant findings. However, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study detected left mesial hippocampal sclerosis ( Figure 1).  On the 2nd day, fluoxetine was administered starting from 10 mg up to 40 mg. On the 21th day, she showed frequent episodic memory loss at the highest dose. Considering the adverse effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as a decreased seizure threshold, fluoxetine was decreased to 30 mg. Aripiprazole was administered starting from 2 mg up to 10 mg, to augment the SSRI activity. On the 28th day, she underwent follow-up neuropsychological assessments, which showed improvements in depression, suicidal ideation, and homicidal ideation. She also showed a decrease of episodic memory loss as improvement in depressive symptoms. Upon discharge, the 35th day from admission, most symptoms had significantly improved on follow-up neuropsychological scales (Table 1). After discharge, she regularly visited us as an outpatient and neither depressive symptoms nor suicidal and homicidal ideation appeared again during this period.   DISCUSSION  In this case report, we present the case of a 16-year-old woman with temporal lobe epilepsy showing persistent suicidal and homicidal ideation, and depressed mood, which improved after taking fluoxetine with aripiprazole augmentation.  The patient presented with temporal lobe epilepsy with left mesial hippocampal sclerosis and psychiatric symptoms including sustained depression, and repetitive suicidal and homicidal ideations. Hippocampal sclerosis describes a pattern of neuronal loss and gliosis involving the medial temporal structures most often encountered in patients with epilepsy. 10 Evidence has emerged in the past decade that MDD is associated with small hippocampal volumes. 4-6 A previous study reported that children and adolescents with temporal lobe epilepsy had moderate to severe depressive symptoms early in the course of their disease, with an impact on their global functional activities. 11 A previous study found that people with epilepsy were four times more likely to be hospitalized than people without epilepsy, and 30% had attempted suicide. 12 Of the suicides committed by people with epilepsy, 81% to 100% occur among those with a co-morbid psychiatric disorder, most commonly depression. 13 Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), especially barbiturates, are frequently involved in suicides and attempts. 14 In 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) issued an alert     Psychiatric Symptoms in TLE  to healthcare professionals about an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and increased suicidality in people taking AEDs. The overall odds ratio (OR) for spontaneously reported suicidal behavior or ideation among those taking active drugs was 1.8 (95% CI: 1.24-2.66). 15 In this case, after the patient took AEDs, her psychiatric symptoms, depression, and suicidal ideation were aggravated, which suggested an association between AEDs and psychiatric symptoms. In addition, she experienced chronic bullying and physical abuse during childhood and sexual abuse twice at age 10. Childhood sexual abuse is a significant early stressor that may predispose individuals to depression and self-destructive behaviors in adulthood. Previous research found reduced hippocampal volume in victims of psychological trauma with severe sexual or physical abuse in childhood. 16 Previous suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, and homicidal ideation were also associated with adolescent suicide. 8 Thus, we considered the association between her psychiatric symptoms, chronic bullying, repeated physical and sexual abuse, and her temporal lobe epilepsy.  The patient showed improvement of psychiatric symptoms in combination treatment with fluoxetine and aripiprazole. Fluoxetine is the only SSRI approved by the FDA for the treatment of depression in patients younger than 18 years of age. 17 Previous research suggested that reduced serotonin receptor 5-HT1A binding may be related to the increased incidence of depression in patients with epilepsy, due to the reduction of serotonergic neurotransmission in hippocampal epileptic foci. 18 Thus, SSRIs may be considered for the treatment of depression in adolescents with epilepsy. Antipsychotics are used not only in the treatment of psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia, but also as adjuncts for depressive disorder. Augmentation with atypical antipsychotic agents was significantly more effective than placebo for response and remission. 19 Aripiprazole received FDA approval for adjunctive therapy in patients with MDD. The product label of aripiprazole recommends a starting dosage of 2-5 mg/day, with a target range of 5-15 mg/day. 20 In a previous study, the mean dose at the end of double-blind treatment was 11.8 mg/day, suggesting that the effective dose for patients with major depressive disorder is lower than that recommended for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. 21 There was a previous case of a 13-year-old boy on aripiprazole and fluoxetine for depression with persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations, and a suicide attempt. 22 In this case, we suggest that the combination of fluoxetine and aripiprazole has therapeutic effects in children and adolescents with temporal lobe epilepsy.  In conclusion, psychiatric symptoms such as depression and suicidal and homicidal ideas are more common in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Unfortunately, however, they are often undiagnosed and untreated. Children and adolescents with epilepsy experience acute and chronic stressors such as family conflicts, difficulty in school performance, stigma, and psychosocial limitation or deprivations due to comorbid psychiatric symptoms. Thus, we consider that psychiatric evaluation and early intervention are important for children and adolescents with epilepsy. In the future, longitudinal and prospective studies for the biological underpinnings and treatment of psychiatric symptoms comorbid with temporal lobe epilepsy are needed.

Several barriers are currently present to the broad-scale adoption of UAVs, or 'drones', as a common tool for ecohydrologic science.Foremost is the current regulatory framework in the United States and the associated public debates on safety and privacy (see Rango and Laliberte 2010, Hardin and Jensen 2011, Hugenholtz et al. 2012 for discussions), with other countries having more progressive approaches.In addition to delays in their broad use in U.S. airspace, a second barrier has been the lack of demonstrations on the utility of UAVs for ecological and hydrological applications.Is it possible to advance ecohydrologic characterizations, process understanding, and predictive skills using remote sensing products from unmanned aerial vehicles?Here, we demonstrate the operational flexibility of two types of UAVs that integrate four elements for autonomous data acquisition at low altitudes (;30-200 m): (1) a gasoline-powered aircraft with positional, velocity and attitude sensors, (2) an on-board computer for flight control and interfacing with sensors, (3) payloads for optical, thermal and multispectral image acquisition, and (4) a wireless network for sending flight instructions and receiving imagery.The overall goal is to translate the research-grade capabilities of small, autonomous vehicles into remotely-sensed imag-ery superior to those obtained from manned aircraft and satellite platforms in terms of spatial and temporal resolution and accuracy, but at lower costs and with greater operational versatility for the individual scientist and/or research team.  This article is aimed at introducing the utility of unmanned aerial vehicles within the data analysis and modeling workflows that are becoming common practice in the emerging field of ecohydrology, commonly defined as the interdisciplinary study of the interactions of water and ecosystems (e.g., Rodrı ´guez-Iturbe 2000, Newman et al. 2006).We focus on UAV deployments over two study areas with longterm research efforts to illustrate how this emerging technology can provide novel insights in ecohydrologic studies at two scales-for landatmosphere investigations at eddy covariance tower sites and for surface and subsurface interaction studies in small watersheds.In both cases, we use the UAV-derived products to interpret and extrapolate continuous observations from environmental sensor networks, which are considered to be a cornerstone of modern field investigations (Hart and Martinez 2006).We also use UAV-derived products as inputs into a distributed parameter model, the Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN)-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS, Ivanov et al. 2004), which is representative of modern modeling tools for ecohydrological applications (e.g., Tague andBand 2004, Niu et al. 2014).Since UAVs are primarily a new platform through which existing sensors can be rapidly deployed in a cost-effective manner, many of the advances in digital photogrammetry, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and multispectral data processing from manned aircraft and satellite observations can be readily transferred.   MULTIPLE UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES AT TWO STUDY SITES  A number of different unmanned aerial vehicle platforms currently exist with potential applications to ecohydrology (see Dunbabin andMarques 2012, Anderson andGaston 2013).These platforms can generally be classified into two types, fixed-or rotary-wing UAVs, although alternative methods using kites (McGarey and Saripalli 2013), tethered balloons (Johnson et al. 2014), and bird flight mimicry (Mackenzie 2012) are also in use.Recent studies have highlighted the scientific applications of UAVs in the disciplines of ecology (e.g., Laliberte and Rango 2011, Getzin et al. 2012, Dandois and Ellis 2013), geomorphology (e.g., Stefanik et al. 2011, d'Oleire-Oltmanns et al. 2012, Niethammer et al. 2012) and atmospheric science (e.g., Dias et al. 2012, Thomas et al. 2012, Reineman et al. 2013).Nevertheless, there has been a very limited use of UAVs in ecohydrology, with some examples related to mapping river morphology (Lejot et al. 2007), and assessing crop water status (Baluja et al. 2012).  Our efforts have concentrated on the deployment of two classes of UAVs (fixed-and rotarywing) at rangeland sites in the southwestern United States: the Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER) near Green Valley, Arizona, and the Jornada Experimental Range (JER) near Las Cruces, New Mexico.Fig. 1a depicts the two sites relative to their locations in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts, respectively.Both locations are representative of the process of woody plant encroachment, a long-term ecohydrological phenomenon that leads to the establishment of woody trees or shrubs in desert grasslands (e.g., Scholes andArcher 1997, Van Auken 2000).This can be readily seen in high-resolution image mosaics (Fig. 1b, c) depicting the distributions of trees, shrubs, grasses and bare soil patches, including the effect of ephemeral reaches on these patterns.In addition to their representative nature, each site was selected due to the existence of long-term precipitation and runoff records in two small watersheds (;1 ha or 0.01 km 2 ) in SRER (Polyakov et al. 2010) and one watershed (;5 ha or 0.05 km 2 ) in JER (Turnbull et al. 2013).  Fig. 2 presents the two UAV platforms deployed at the SRER and JER sites: the rotarywing SR30 helicopter (Rotomotion LLC, Charleston, SC) and the fixed-wing BAT 3 airplane (MLB Company, Santa Clara, CA).After manual launching from a catapult (BAT 3) or vertical takeoff (SR30), each autonomous vehicle is controlled through a wireless network from a central location (canopy tent or trailer) from which flight information and adjustments are sent and rapid images retrieved (Rango et al. 2009, Lin andSaripalli 2012).Due to current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, the autonomous operation requires an onthe-ground pilot who maintains line-of-sight with the UAV at all times (see discussion on operational rules in Rango and Laliberte 2010).Autonomous flight patterns from each platform are tailored to the size of the study area, the flight altitude and duration, and the desired ground resolution of the UAV-derived products.Table 1 compares the two UAV platforms, indicating the trade-offs that exist between flight altitude, duration and payload capacity.Data processing constraints, such as requirements for aerial image overlaps to ensure horizontal and vertical accuracy (e.g., Laliberte andRango 2011, Fonstad et al. 2013), also play an important role.To protect equipment and ensure safety, landing is typically performed manually either to a landing pad (SR30) or on a dirt airstrip (BAT 3).Due to the rapid and low-cost UAV deployments and the experiences gained at each site, repeat flights have been carried out to capture seasonal variations in vegetation cover, with a focus on conditions prior to during and after the North American monsoon (Laliberte et al. 2011, Templeton et al. 2014).  The capacity to carry multiple payloads and trigger image acquisition simultaneously affords UAV platforms an advantage over other methods.Table 1 describes the current optical, multispectral and thermal sensors available on the fixed-and rotary-wing UAVs and estimates of the ground resolution (,0.5 m) obtained from typical altitudes.For each sensor type, we have developed workflows for image acquisition, orthorectification, and mosaicking using the global positioning system and inertial measurement unit (GPS/IMU) onboard each UAV (e.g., Laliberte andRango 2011, Lin andSaripalli 2012).Fig. 1c illustrates the type of color image mosaics at 6 cm resolution obtained at JER from the BAT 3 platform, where over 30,000 images and 200 mosaics have been generated since 2006 (Rango et al., in press).Workflows also include a range of image processing techniques to extract features using object-based classification (Laliberte et al. 2012), to derive three-dimensional point clouds from image mosaics (Krishnan et al. 2012), and to calibrate multispectral images for vegetation mapping (Laliberte et al. 2011).Image analyses from the multiple UAV classes have yielded a wealth of multi-temporal, high-resolution datasets that can be linked to ground surveys of terrain, vegetation or soil conditions (e.g., Anderson 2013, Pierini 2013, Templeton et al. 2014).Furthermore, the site characterizations possible with the UAV-derived products at different scales are useful for examining continuous ecohydrologic measurements or for con-   APPLICATIONS TO LAND-ATMOSPHERE INTERACTION STUDIES  Anderson and Gaston (2013) suggest that unmanned aerial vehicles might be useful for characterizing the time-variable sampling footprints around eddy covariance (EC) sites.For areas with heterogeneous cover, this is particularly important given the differing sensible, latent and ground heat flux contributions from bare patches and different plant species (e.g., Detto et al. 2006, Vivoni et al. 2010).Fig. 3 presents an example of the utility of the rotary-wing UAV in a recent land-atmosphere interaction study conducted at the SRER, with an analogous effort at JER (Anderson 2013).We acquired images from low-altitude SR30 flights (;30 m), mosaicked the 5 cm images using the Structure from Motion (SfM, e.g., Turner et al. 2012) technique (Fig. 3a) and classified them based on the pixel values of the Red, Green and Blue (RGB) signature into three types (grass, tree and soil, Fig. 3b).The vegetation classification provides a means to aggregate the ground-based measurements of soil moisture and soil temperature obtained from a network of twenty sensor profiles established in the EC footprint.Thus, the UAV-derived vegetation map is a novel means to up-scale the land surface conditions sampled by the environmental sensor network within the daily sampling footprint of the EC site.We estimated the EC footprint using the model of Kormann and Meixner (2001) at the daily scale, aggregated this to the summer season in 2012 and displayed it as the 50% contribution contour line in Fig. 3.Note how twelve sensor profiles lie in the timeaveraged EC footprint for this season, while others fall outside.The locations of daily peak flux contributions (stars in Fig. 3a) are typically clustered around the EC tower (T).A few sensor profiles were placed in a large grass area located 30 m north of the tower and contribute to the observed fluxes during days with northerly winds (Anderson 2013).  The high resolution afforded by the UAVderived imagery opens the door for detailed spatial analyses to link the EC footprint (FP) to the environmental sensor network.Fig. 3b illustrates this by comparing the FP for Septem-ber 13, 2012, shown as 3 m pixel percentage contributions, to the spatial distribution of dailyaveraged soil moisture (SM).For this day, areas with larger contributions occur to the south, southeast and northwest of the tower and exhibit higher SM.A spatial average of soil moisture in the daily FP can be estimated by weighting those sensor profiles within specific patches using the vegetation percentages in the daily FP (Anderson 2013).Spatially-aggregated conditions in the FP can then be compared to latent, sensible and ground heat fluxes measured at the EC site (Vivoni et al. 2010).For example, Fig. 3c shows the observed latent heat flux at the EC tower and a nearby site (labeled 'alternate observation' and used to fill data gaps) during summer 2012.For September 13, 2012, the EC footprint and soil moisture spatial distributions (Fig. 3b) are linked to a period of high latent heat flux (;525 W/m 2 ) occurring a few days after a rainy period (;50 mm in two days).The observed latent heat flux is captured well for this day by a simulation using the tRIBS model (Pierini et al., in press) that accounts for the UAV-derived vegetation cover in the seasonal FP (67% grass, 23% tree, 10% soil).Furthermore, the model captures well the seasonal evolution of observed surface soil moisture in the environmental sensor network as well as conditions during the day of interest (Fig. 3d).  Here, spatial averages and standard deviations are shown for 21 sensor profiles (including the EC site) weighted by the vegetation distribution in the seasonal FP.  The application of a rotary-wing UAV to a land-atmosphere interaction study at SRER showed the utility of the high-resolution imagery products for deriving a vegetation map used to scale up ground measurements and weight model simulations in an eddy covariance sampling footprint.Several challenges remain with respect to the use of UAVs at the space and time scales of eddy covariance measurements (see a broader discussion of challenges in Hardin and Jensen 2011).We based this example on a single flight in March 2011 prior to summer greening due to the North American monsoon (Forzieri et al. 2011).Repeat UAV flights coinciding with phenological stages would significantly improve the vegetation classification.This would allow for a time-variable weighting of the environmental sensor network and model outputs that v www.esajournals.orgFig. 3. Application of UAV products for land-atmosphere interaction studies.(a) 5 cm resolution RGB image from rotary-wing UAV near EC tower at SRER with twenty soil moisture and temperature sensor profiles (5, 15 and 30 cm depths).Also shown are the boundary of the EC footprint (FP) at 50% contribution for summer 2012 (July 1 to September 30) and locations of peak footprint contributions from individual days in that period.(b) 2 m resolution vegetation classes derived from the UAV RGB image in three categories (grass, tree and soil) along with the percent footprint contribution in 3 m resolution pixels for a single day (September 13, 2012).Also shown is the spatial distribution of measured volumetric soil moisture (SM) at 15 cm depth averaged for that day.(c) Comparison of simulated and observed latent heat flux at the EC site for summer 2012.Simulations account for UAV-derived vegetation cover in the FP (67% grass, 23% tree, 10% soil).Alternate observation during the period of instrument failure was obtained from a nearby (1 km distant) EC site.(d) Comparison of simulated and observed volumetric soil moisture (m 3 /m 3 ) in top 10 cm for summer 2012.This is shown as spatial averages (solid lines) and spatial standard deviations (61 std envelope) across 21 sensor profiles in the northern watershed (Fig. 1b) weighted according to the vegetation cover in the EC footprint.  v www.esajournals.orgaccount for the daily variability in the sampling footprint as well as less frequent variations (e.g., weekly to monthly, depending on UAV flight scheduling) in vegetation structure.Furthermore, multispectral imagery from a UAV over different time periods would allow a direct estimation of vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), that are suited for characterizing vegetation type and phenology (e.g., Laliberte et al. 2011) Wood et al. (2011) suggest that hyperresolution modeling of surface and subsurface interactions requires observations on the order of tens of meters.Although it is more likely that satellitebased platforms will meet this need over large regions, UAVs provide finer resolution datasets (,1 m) useful for disaggregating coarser products.In addition, UAV-derived products can be used to parameterize and test ecohydrology models in ways analogous to the use of LiDAR data from manned aircraft (Mahmood andVivoni 2011, Gutie ´rrez-Jurado andVivoni 2013).Fig. 4 is an example of the utility of a fixed-wing UAV for a surface and subsurface study at the Tromble Weir (TW) watershed at JER, with an analogous effort occurring at SRER.We conducted low-altitude (;200 m) flights with the BAT 3 over the area about four times per year (2010-2013) to coincide with plant phenology stages (Templeton et al. 2014).For each flight, highresolution (6 cm), overlapping RGB images were orthorectified using a set of ground control points and mosaicked to cover the TW watershed.Initially, the watershed boundary and stream network were known imprecisely based on a ground survey with a low accuracy GPS (see Rango et al., in press).Using an image mosaic from October 2010, we derived a 1 m 'bare earth' digital elevation model (DEM, Fig. 4a) and a 1 m canopy height model (CHM) from the threedimensional point cloud and tested both products with a high-accuracy, differential GPS and plant height measurements at about 100 locations.We then conducted terrain processing of the DEM to derive maps of terrain slope, curvature, single-flow direction, upstream area and the stream network.Fig. 4a, c depict the watershed and sub-watersheds upstream of the outlet (Smith et al. 1981) and three internal flumes (Wainwright et al. 2002) as well as the stream network, which was verified using the differential GPS.Clearly, the UAV products provide novel insight into the terrain characteristics of the study site (see Templeton et al. 2014).Laliberte et al. (2011) describes our efforts to produce and test a species-level vegetation classification based on a BAT 3 flight with a multispectral camera in May 2011.Comparisons of the 1 m resolution classification to ;1100 identified plants revealed an accuracy of 87%.Fig. 4b shows the spatial distributions of two grass and seven shrub species in addition to bare soil, the dominant cover.Table 2 defines the acronyms used in Fig. 4b and provides areal estimates of the species-specific cover within three areas: the watershed boundary, the 50% contribution footprint of an EC tower (Templeton et al. 2014), and the 50% footprint of a COsmicray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) sensor (e.g., Zreda et al. 2008Zreda et al. , 2012)).Some species vary in their cover percentages across the three domains due to preferential terrain locations.For example, the shrub Parthenium incanum (mariola) occurs more frequently in the watershed as it is located on mild slopes rather than the flatter surfaces near the EC site (see Rango et al., in press).Associated with these patterns are canopy height estimates which can quantify how plant size is linked to terrain positioning (as possible with LiDAR, see Forzieri et al. 2009, Gutie ´rrez-Jurado and Vivoni 2013), with typically taller shrubs in the upper flat surfaces and within the stream network.The UAV-derived vegetation classifications also reveal the varying role of bare soil patches in the watersheds at JER (;66%) and SRER (;25%), indicating how different the vegetation organization is within the two woody plant encroachment areas (Anderson 2013).   APPLICATIONS TO SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE INTERACTION STUDIES  High-resolution terrain and vegetation products provide a detailed context to interpret  observations from the environmental sensor network and to conduct ecohydrologic simulations.We established networks to sample water and energy states and fluxes within the watershed (Fig. 4a) and within the EC sampling footprint (Fig. 4b), derived in an analogous fashion to SRER.Based on the rainfall, soil moisture and runoff measurements, Templeton et al. (2014) tested if closing the watershed water balance provided accurate daily evapotranspiration estimates as compared to EC observations.A better match was obtained when soil moisture data from the three transects was averaged to the watershed scale using the UAV-derived aspect and elevation fields as a weighting scheme.Similarly, we found that the percentage cover of bare soil derived from the UAV within the timevariable EC footprint helped explain observed day-to-day differences in evaporative fraction, defined as the ratio of latent heat flux to total turbulent fluxes (Anderson 2013).Both terrain and vegetation products serve as spatiallydistributed input to the tRIBS model applied to the TW watershed and as a means to upscale the sensor observations.Fig. 4c shows the highresolution TIN (equivalent cell size of ;1 m for 47,462 Voronoi polygons) derived from the DEM along with the watershed boundary and stream network using the methods of Vivoni et al. (2004).Terrain attributes and vegetation types derived from the UAV products are captured explicitly in the Voronoi polygons.For example, the model domain incorporates higher slope areas near channel banks (Templeton et al. 2014) and the important connectivity between bare soil patches in areas with woody plant encroachment (e.g., Mueller et al. 2007, Okin et al. 2009).Effects of landscape characteristics are apparent in the surface and subsurface interactions simulated by the model.For example, Fig. 4d presents the observed and simulated depthaveraged SM for a single day (August 11, 2011).The model captures well the relatively high soil moisture occurring during this day when averaged over the basin (;0.07 m 3 /m 3 ), as compared to observations that are aggregated using an aspect-elevation weighting scheme (Fig. 4d, inset), with adequate performance throughout the summer.Spatial patterns in soil moisture for August 11, 2011, show a progressive wetting toward the stream network in the model and observations, an indication of important lateral fluxes within hillslopes, as well as the controls of landscape features on soil moisture (e.g., drier areas along steep channel banks).The high-resolution application of UAV products in the spatially-distributed model and the comparisons to the detailed environmental sensor network demonstrate the potential for exploring the link between spatial patterns and processes at the watershed scale (Vivoni 2012a).Several challenges remain in the application of UAVs to surface and subsurface interaction studies at the scales of interest to ecohydrology.We conducted our model-data intercomparisons in a relatively small (;5 ha) watershed that is not amenable to coarse (10-100 m) satellite-based observations to characterize, for example, land surface temperature or greenness patterns on a daily scale (e.g., Vivoni 2012b, Xiang et al. 2014).To do so would necessitate multiple flights from the same UAV (or multiple UAVs with similar sensors) over much larger regions at nearly the same time.If coordinated with satellite overpass times, the spatial variability of land surface states within satellite footprints could be quantified, in an analogous fashion to field campaigns with manned aircraft (e.g., Famiglietti et al. 1999, Mascaro et al. 2011), but at higher resolutions, reduced costs and lower logistical efforts.Furthermore, characterizing land surface temperature through thermal sensors, vegetation indices using a multispectral camera or possibly an index of soil wetness through their combination (e.g., Moran et al. 1994, Gillies et al. 1997) on board UAV platforms would provide much needed datasets to test the spatial predictions of ecohydrologic models.Clearly, the larger simulation regions would require using the parallel computing capabilities of spatially-explicit models (e.g., Vivoni et al. 2011, Wood et al. 2011) to conduct long-term simulations, ensemble forecasts or assessments of modeling uncertainty.In addition, UAVs and their derived products might help address an important uncertainty source, namely the spatial distribution of soil characteristics at scales comparable to terrain and vegetation patterns.   FUTURE DIRECTIONS  The advent of unmanned aerial vehicles as new platforms for remote sensing in the earth v www.esajournals.organd environmental sciences is part of the everincreasing sophistication in technology available to individual scientists and small research teams.Coupled with environmental sensor networks, satellite-based remote sensing, and high-performance numerical modeling, ecohydrology and its allied fields are entering into an unprecedented period of data and model output availability, a new age of information to be assessed, classified and synthesized to monitor changes, advance process understanding and improve predictions in light of these changes (see, for example, Hampton et al. 2013).Empowered with the tailored products from UAVs in a self-service (do-it-yourself ) approach, investigators could accurately track rapid landscape transformations, such as drought-induced plant mortality, invasive species, post-fire recovery or urbanization, in a spatially-explicit manner that can be integrated with more detailed monitoring at long-term sites such as the Long-term Ecological Research Network (LTER) or National Ecological Observing Network (NEON).Furthermore, ecohydrology with UAVs opens up new opportunities to approach the spatiotemporal resolutions required to understand the details of and adequately represent ecohydrologic systems faithfully in numerical models.How the ecohydrologic community deals with high-resolution imagery that approximates the actual scales of field observations and the scales of validity of model equations will dictate, to a large measure, our success in advancing the discipline and increasing our impact to society.

Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-399-AC5, 2021 RC2: This paper presents a simple data-driven model, call STREAM, to estimate global runoff using satellite observations of precipitation, soil moisture, and total water storage anomalies (TWSA). The structure of the model is simple but clear -precipitation and soil moisture are used to estimate surface quick flow while TWSA is used to compute underground slow flow. It is shown that the model can be used to estimate runoff at a basin scale after careful calibrations, which is evidenced by the validation over five calibrated sections inFigure 4.AC: The authors are thankful to the reviewer for their assessment of our paper. We have provided a point-by-point reply to each of the comments in the sequel.RC2: However, I doubt very much whether the model can be used for the global runoff estimation since 8 parameters need to be well calibrated based on observed river discharge, which will, to a large extent, limit its application on a global scale.  AC: The intent of the paper is to describe a model that could be used for the estimation of river flow (and runoff) worldwide. However, as correctly stated by the reviewer, the model results are only shown for the Mississippi River basin and the \"Global\" in the title may not be appropriate. Consistent with the reviewer's assertion, the article and model should be evaluated for their ability to estimate river flow and runoff in the Mississippi River Basin, not globally. In the revised version of the manuscript, the term \"Global\" from the title will be removed.  The possibility to regionalize the model parameters for the estimation of river discharge at global scale is a topic beyond the scope of this article. However, the authors are working on the regionalization of the model parameters. Preliminary results, which will be shown at the next EGU 2021 conference, demonstrate the possibility to link model parameter values to the basin characteristics, still obtaining satisfactory results.  RC2: For example, the validation results over the gauged sections not used in the calibration phase do not show very good performance of the model as the difference between simulations and observed river discharge may go beyond 1000 m3/s in most sections. The authors attribute this difference to the presence of dams, but this may also happen in sections without dams such as sections 3 and 7.  AC: As any hydrological model calibrated against observed data, it is expected that the best performances of STREAM model can be obtained over the calibrated gauging sections whereas the performances will decrease over the gauging sections not used for the calibration. However, gauging section 3 and section 7 cannot be taken as reference to understand if the STREAM model is suitable for reproducing river discharge over not calibrated sections as they are affected by local characteristics (section 7 is located over the Rock river (near Joslin), a tributary of Mississippi river) and by the presence of an important dam (section 3).  Moreover, we underline that a decrease in the model performance is obtained for all hydrological models. We are preparing a second paper showing the comparison between STREAM and other global hydrological model performances, and STREAM model is working similarly (and even better) than other models (much more complex and with a much larger number of parameters). Preliminary results have been shown at EGU conference in 2020 (https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-13718).  RC2: On the other hand, this paper highlights the use of three satellite observations of precipitation, soil moisture, and TWSA. However, these three components are highly correlated with each other. For example, soil moisture can be used to estimate rainfall through the SM2RAIN algorithm [1]. Another example is that, on a regional scale, TWSA is very synchronous with soil moisture [2]. Accordingly, the synergy between precipitation, soil moisture, and TWSA, to me, shall be very limited.  AC: The reviewer is right that precipitation, soil moisture and TWSA are in some way correlated but this does not represent a problem for our approach. The proposed STREAM model is a conceptual hydrological model where the inputs contribute to the different runoff components according to specific laws. Specifically, soil moisture and precipitation contribute to the quick component of runoff (daily time scale) while TWSA contributes to the slow component (monthly scale). The differences in the temporal (and spatial) scale of the input data allow us to use the different input consistently and to optimize their synergy for runoff estimation.  Likely, the misunderstanding could have been generated as in the text the STREAM model is defined as a \"data-driven model\" to indicate that the model is mainly based on the contribution of the input data rather than of complex equations and processes.  RC2: For these reasons, I suggest rejecting this paper as is.  AC: We hope that with these new explanations the reviewer might reconsider their decision. In line 344, the meaning of the Horton-Strahler order is not clear. In lines 444-445, the authors mention that the performance of model in section 3 is not bad. However, as I checked from Figure 5, the difference between simulated and observed discharge can go beyond 8000 m3/s.

We support its continued accrual, and encourage existing participants and new centres to enter patients. Only in this way can we clarify the use and sequencing of combination chemotherapy as quickly as possible.  In our editorial 'Why hasn't the National Institute been NICE to patients with colorectal cancer', we highlighted the disparity of treatment in England and Wales compared to other industrialised countries, particularly with respect to the poor 5-year survival figures. Our concerns focused on the conclusions reached by the NICE panel in the face of two prospective, randomised trials involving more than 1000 patients showing a survival advantage in *Correspondence: Dr M Saunders, E-mail: mark.saunders@christie-tr.nwest.nhs.uk favour of first-line irinotecan-based therapy (Douillard et al, 2000;Saltz et al, 2000).   REFERENCES  We only referred to the MRC CRO8 (FOCUS) study since the NICE panel recommended entering patients into this trial and were planning to review their guidance when the results from this study are available. We never questioned the ethical validity of the FOCUS study. We simply pointed out that NICE seem to have linked their guidance very closely to this study and feel that they have frankly misinterpreted the many positive studies from here and abroad. NICE also failed to appreciate that patients who were randomised into the two oxaliplatin arms were unable to receive irinotecan at any point, even though they supported second-line use of this drug. We were not questioning the FOCUS study; we simply alluded to this disparity created by NICE. Since our editorial was published, the FOCUS study has, in our opinion, quite rightly added a third-tier of treatment, so allowing all patients to receive both oxaliplatin and irinotecan at some point.  However, according to NICE recommendations, patients who prefer not to be entered into this study should only receive 5-Fluorouracil and folinic acid (5FU/FA) 'up-front', unless they fall into the very small group of patients that have potentially operable liver metastases.  With the widespread availability of the internet and because we need to provide enough information to allow patients to give informed consent, they are quite rightly questioning the NICE guidance in a similar manner to the 28 colorectal oncologists who wrote to the Daily Telegraph in June. Patients are also rightly concerned that the NICE guidance was influenced too much by government funding constraints rather than clinical-effectiveness. We would strongly urge NICE to consider a fresh review before 2005, based on both the convincing existing data (Douillard et al, 2000;Saltz et al, 2000) and the rapidly emerging new data using all three drugs -planned or unplanned (Tournigand et al, 2001;Goldberg et al, 2002).

However, the reason for criticism of the NICE guidance is due to the overwhelming evidence that access to the three drugs 5fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin is the optimal therapeutic approach to metastatic colorectal cancer. Subsequent to this guidance entry into the revised FOCUS protocol is the only way that patients in the UK can access all these agents. Therefore, patients not participating in the FOCUS trial will receive suboptimal therapy. Although the median survival for FOCUS of 16 months is encouraging, and certainly a major step forward over CRO6 with a median survival of approximately 10 months(Maughan et al, 2002), it remains significantly less than that for patients treated with all three agents in randomised trials such as N9741(Goldberg et al, 2002)and the Tournigand trial(Tournigand et al, 2001) Irinotecan combined with fluorouracil compared with fluorouracil alone as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer: a multicentre randomised trial.

Introduction  Due to many advantages, biocatalysts are becoming more and more attractive for the development of sustainable and innovative biotechnological processes.Being highly specific and efficient, this transformation will contribute to the implementation of \"greener\" and sustainable industrial processes.This environmentally friendly approach is crucial for the development of Circular Bioeconomy which will find application in many fields including food, feed, textile, pharmaceutical, health, and renewable energy (Antranikian and Streit 2022).The enzymes of interest include all seven enzyme classes: oxidoreductases (EC 1) transferases (EC 2), hydrolases (EC 3), lyases (EC 4), isomerases (EC 5), ligases (EC 6), and translocases (EC 7).A number of representatives of these classes have been shown to be able to increase the turnover rate in second-and third-generation biorefineries (Zuliani et al. 2021), underlining the need for the 5 Page 2 of 27 discovery of novel enzymes.Future demand for enzymes for example comprises in fields of sustainable material recycling (e.g., PET degradation, Wei et al. 2019), medical science (e.g., biofilm deconstruction, Costa et al. 2020) or de novo synthesis of biomolecules with complex enzyme cascades (Yi et al. 2021).  Especially enzymes derived from extremophilic microorganisms (extremozymes) are attractive candidates for industrial processes that run under extreme conditions such as high temperatures, high pressure, high solvent concentration, high salinity, and at extremes of pH (Elleuche et al. 2014;Krüger et al. 2018;Singh and Ray 2021).Beside higher activity and stability under harsh conditions, extremozymes offer further attractive properties like simplified purification and better productivity (Siddiqui 2015).In the last five decades, a number of unique enzymes from extremophiles has been studied in detail and showed activities between − 10 and 120 °C and pH 0.2 to 12.One of the most fascinating group of microorganisms are thermophiles, including bacteria and archaea, that can survive at elevated temperatures from 50 up to 120 °C.They are present worldwide in hightemperature environments, which are caused by natural geothermal processes or man-made conditions (e.g., hot water tubes, compost).Many of these habitats are geothermal springs, which are quite diverse and appear as water springs, geysers or fumaroles in terrestrial, shallow marine or deep sea habitats.  In Europe and Caucasus region, such environments are spread over the whole continent.There are hotspots in separated insularity on the mid-Atlantic ridge (Iceland, Azores) as well as geothermal sites on the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea (Italy, Greece) and central locations (Portugal, Spain, Caucasus mountains).In the last 50 years, archaea as well as bacteria have been isolated by classical enrichment methods.Bacteria being the majority probably due to the challenging cultivation of archaea (Suleiman et al. 2020).The latest development in molecular biology and bioinformatics including metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics contributed significantly to the exploration of such habitats in detail shedding light on biodiversity, metabolic pathways, and enzymology.  Although many microbial species of hot springs seem to be globally distributed, isolated terrestrial habitats can lead to diversification of the genomes in correlation to the geographic distance (Erikstad et al. 2019).Therefore, investigation of different hot spring habitats can reveal multiple enzyme variants which were selected and improved by nature during evolution.The obtained sequence and structure variations are useful to understand their effects on the enzyme properties.This knowledge advances rational design in enzyme engineering and will contribute to design enzymes with desired properties for various applications (Watanabe et al. 2018;Ali et al. 2020).  In this review, we will give an overview on the distribution of hot springs (above 50 °C) in Europe and Caucasus region and present information regarding their biodiversity and enzymology, which is of relevance to biotechnological processes.We will present the variety of methods applied in screening for novel thermostable enzymes and highlight the current trends and future perspectives.   Hot springs  Life is able to thrive under a variety of extreme conditions.Hot springs can be found all over the world and are the breeding pool for life itself (Des Marais and Walter 2019).They form when groundwater is geothermally heated by the Earth's crust and rises to the surface.This process occurs in volcanic areas and also non-volcanic areas, by contact with magma or geothermal heat from the Earth's interior, respectively (Mehta and Satyanarayana 2013).Extensive mineralization occurs while the heated water is ascending through the Earth and dissolving minerals on its way, leading to a saturation of different minerals, including H 2 S, CO 2 , CH 4 , H 2 , NH 3 , low-molecular-weight compounds, and trace elements (Brock 1978).In addition, reduced chemical compounds and other solutes are delivered to more oxidized surface environments, providing redox energy and nutrients (Des Marais and Walter 2019).Thus, diverse chemical compositions and thermal gradients are created and are able to harbor a great diversity and abundance of microbial communities.Depending on the dissolved minerals and other solutes, the pH of a hot spring can vary from pH 0.1 to pH 11, each with their own dominating organisms (Dodds and Whiles 2010).  Besides hot water springs, other types of springs can be found.A geyser is a special kind of terrestrial hot spring which can generally be found near active volcanic areas (Mehta and Satyanarayana 2013).Surface water moves down and comes in contact with hot rocks at a depth of around 2000 m, leading to boiling of the pressurized water.Water and steam are then ejected through the geyser´s surface vent and can exceed heights of 115 m (Dodds and Whiles 2010;Reed et al. 2021).  Another kind of terrestrial hot spring is the fumarole.A fumarole is a steam vent that emerges through an opening in the Earth's crust like cracks or long fissures, emitting steam and gasses (i.e., CO 2 , SO 2 , HCl, H 2 S), as well as on the surface of lava flows (Satyanarayana et al. 2013).If a fumarole emits sulfurous gasses, it is called a solfatara and can be found within so-called solfataric fields.Magma chambers located beneath these soils, mud pots, and sulfurrich springs heat up these solfatara to temperatures of up Page 3 of 27 5 to 100 °C (Satyanarayana et al. 2013).Black smokers are marine hydrothermal fumaroles able to heat the surrounding water above 400 °C (Stetter;Colín-García, 2016).These hydrothermal vents are a part of a subaqueous hydrothermal system which, much like terrestrial hot springs, are rich in nutrients and are also considered to be a potential cradle for the origin of life and can be found in the deep sea along mid ocean ridges (Mehta and Satyanarayana 2013;Colín-García, 2016;Des Marais and Walter 2019).Marine vents can also occur in shallow waters close to the shore, like at Vulcano Island (Italy), where they exhibit temperatures of 80-105 °C at depths of 1-10 m (Stetter 2001).Depending on the tide, some of these shallow marine vents can lie dry or below the water surface, showing marine and terrestrial properties alike.  Terrestrial hot springs can be found all over the world, with the most prominent sites being Iceland, New Zealand, Chile, Japan and specifically Kamchatka (Russia) and the Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming, USA) (Satyanarayana et al. 2013).In 1969, Brock and Freeze isolated the thermophile Thermus aquaticus from a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park, setting the starting point for research on thermophilic extremophiles (Brock and Freeze 1969).Following this pioneering research, the understanding of the upper temperature limit for life grew, as Fiala and Stetter isolated Pyrococcus furiosus from geothermally heated marine sediment, an archaeon with an optimal temperature of growth at 100 °C (Fiala and Stetter 1986).Pyrolobus fumarii, isolated from a black smoker wall, exhibited an even higher temperature of growth with 113 °C (Blöchl et al. 1997).However, the archaeon \"strain 121\", also isolated from a black smoker, is able to grow at a temperature of 121 °C, defining the upper limit for life to date (Kashefi and Lovley 2003).   Strategies for enzyme screening  Thermophilic microorganisms from hot springs are a valuable source of stable enzymes for biotechnological applications.For the identification of these enzymes, versatile approaches have been developed in the last decades (Fig. 1).Enzymes were discovered directly from the isolated microorganisms itself or by screening for enzymeencoding genes.The latter technique was a milestone for recombinant enzyme production in optimized expression strains like E. coli as well as for understanding of their sequence and function relationship.Screening for enzymeencoding genes can be achieved by different approaches, optionally including enrichment strategies followed by either activity-based or sequence-based screening methods.According to different publication analyses, the vast majority of enzymes in the past was screened by functionbased screening approaches (Ferrer et al. 2016;Berini et al. 2017).Nevertheless, in the last few years, functionbased screening is increasingly replaced by the cheaper and even faster sequence-based approaches (Kelly et al. 2020).The starting point for all these strategies is isolated DNA either from a single species (genomic DNA) or from a microbial community of an environmental sample or enrichment cultures (metagenomic DNA).In addition, RNA for (meta-)transcriptome analysis or proteins for (meta-)proteome analysis can be used as well.   Enrichment and strain isolation  This classical approach has been implemented for more than a half-century and led to the discovery of unique microorganisms, metabolic pathways, and enzymes.An enrichment culture of an environmental sample can support the growth of suitable microorganisms found in a consortium.Samples are taken from an environment and incubated in a medium containing growth requiring nutrients.Moreover, the cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic microorganism requires special methods and media.By adding a selected substrate, specialized microorganisms are enriched.Beside the classical cultivation of microorganisms in laboratory, in situ enrichments are an attractive strategy.Hereby, the desired substrates and an inoculum are within a membrane locked compartment, which is directly added to the hot spring sampling sites to enable exchange of minerals and conditions.Such in situ enrichments were performed, for example, in two hot springs in Iceland with starch prior to screening of starch-and pullulan-modifying enzymes (Labes et al. 2008) as well as with diverse biopolymers in Russia and Iceland for screening of thermostable hydrolases (Wohlgemuth et al. 2018).  As shown in Fig. 1, an enrichment culture can be further treated and isolation of pure cultures can be achieved by classical microbiology methods.In the beginning of the era of enzyme discovery, classical enrichment and isolation followed by activity assays were the key strategies for identifying enzyme-producing microorganisms.This approach has been successful in the discovery of various classes of heat stable enzymes including carbohydrases, proteases, and lipases in the last decades.With plant polymers as substrates, microbial species producing thermostable enzymes like cellulases, xylanases, and oxidoreductases were identified.  However, recombinant production or enzyme improvement require the corresponding gene sequences.In this regard, additional activity-based screening of (meta-) genomic libraries or sequence-based screening techniques are necessary.Therefore, enrichment strategies are often 5 Page 4 of 27 applied prior to activity-or sequence-based screening of enzyme-encoding genes.By this, they can increase screening success and reduce the screening costs and effort.Moreover, they can be useful when target substrates occur in low concentrations in nature or for hardly degradable substrates.Recently, this approach was also successful for the enrichment of microorganisms capable of metabolizing the hardly biodegradable PET which was the origin for the identification of PET-degrading enzyme classes (Yoshida et al. 2016).   Activity-based screening  Activity-based screening of thermophilic isolates marked the beginning of the discovery and characterization of thermostable enzymes.For decades, this strategy was state of the art and during this time, many of the fundamental concepts of plate-based activity assays were developed.Well-established and common assays utilize dye-coupled polymers (e.g., polysaccharides and polypeptides) or pH shifts.These techniques provided a basis for the later emerging screening of (meta-)genomic libraries as well.(Meta)-genomic libraries are necessary for identifying the enzyme-encoding genes.The encoding genes are required for the heterologous overexpression in production hosts (e.g., E. coli, Bacillus sp.) as well as to determine sequence motifs, domain structures, and an enzyme classification system.  For constructing (meta)-genomic libraries, genomic or metagenomic DNA has to be isolated, fragmented and subcloned into appropriate vectors.Plasmids, fosmids, phagemid, cosmid, or BAC-based systems are available whereas fosmid and plasmid libraries are often preferred (Berini et al. 2017).Vectors have then to be transferred to a screening host to induce gene expression whereby almost exclusively E. coli is used.Typical bottlenecks like promoter recognition, codon usage, and proper folding for enzyme activation have led to alternative expression systems like Thermus thermophilus (Angelov et al. 2009;Leis et al. 2015).  The main advantage of activity-based screening is the identification of totally new enzyme classes or enzymes with unknown domain structures.Knowledge of sequences or protein structures is not required, though sensitive and selective intelligent screening assays have to be available.Beside plate-based activity screening of (meta-)genomic libraries, microtiter plate-based liquid assays, which are photometrically accessible, have been successfully applied.Multiple assays in parallel, robotics, and/or cell-free expression can increase hit rates and minimize material input and time (Maruthamuthu et al. 2016;Dixit et al. 2021;Rolf et al. 2019;Markel et al. 2020).Challenges with novel target substrates like, for example, artificial plastic polymers are mastered with model substrates like oligomers or functionalized esters for PET degradation (Charnock 2021;Pirillo et al. 2021).   Sequence-based screening approaches  This approach focuses on DNA sequences that are generated by sequencing of pure microbial strains, mixed cultures or environmental samples.DNA and RNA can be isolated from these samples without an active microbial population.From this data, information regarding the biodiversity in different habitats and enzymology can be analyzed in detail.  With an increasing number of enzyme sequences in databases and improved prediction tools, sequence-based screening approaches are advancing dramatically.The first approaches started with degenerated primers based on sequence alignments with subsequent PCR and genome walking (Kotik 2009).This was an expedient but laborious strategy for creating a collection of similar genes which is nowadays almost completely replaced by next generation sequencing methods.For this, a tool box has been developed which could be adapted to the particular environment and screening approach.A comprehensive overview of the principles of library preparation (DNA extraction, fragmentation, adapter insertion), sequencing platforms (Roche 454, Illumina, AB SOLiD, Helicos Biosciences, Nanopore Min-ION, PacBio), and tools for quality control, genome assembly as well as taxonomic and functional annotation is given by Almeida and Martinis (2019).A detailed comparison of tools and strategies for sequence data analysis is reported by Pal et al. (2018) and Robinson et al. (2021).  Compared to the activity-based screening approaches mentioned above, sequence-based screening can reach a much higher number of putative enzyme candidates in shorter times (Ferrer et al. 2016).Preselection processes need to be applied like in silico function and structure prediction or even a combination with activity-based approaches to identify the most promising enzyme candidates.Multi-\"omic\" approaches can overcome limitations in activity prediction and the enormous number of putative enzyme candidates (Krüger et al. 2020).By combining data from metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, or metaproteomics, more detailed information regarding biodiversity and enzymology of microbial communities can be presented.Such a strategy has been already applied for biogas plant analysis (Bremges et al. 2015) and analysis of hot spring communities (Busch et al. 2021).  The bottleneck is the successful production of recombinant enzymes in expression strains such as E. coli, Bacillus sp. or yeasts.Gene synthesis can overcome codon usage limitations whereas proper folding of proteins from thermophiles can be improved by thermophilic expression strains like Thermus thermophilus (Moreno et al. 2003;Fujino et al. 2020), Saccharolobus solfataricus (Albers et al. 2006), Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (Suzuki and Kurosawa 2016) or Geobacillus thermodenitrificans (Daas et al. 2018).   Screening of hot springs in Europe and Caucasus  Hot springs caused by geothermal activities are spread worldwide.Like other continents, Europe and Caucasus regions harbor a vast abundance of terrestrial hot springs that have been analyzed to gain fundamental knowledge in microbiology by isolation of strains or metagenomic analysis.Accompanied with that, the screening of thermoactive enzymes was performed in parallel or based on the microbial isolates or metagenomic datasets.  Analyzed terrestrial springs with temperatures above 50 °C that harbor thermophilic microorganisms are mainly found in Southern Europe (Fig. 2).Due to the drifting of 5 Page 6 of 27 tectonic plates on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, hotspots of terrestrial hot springs are present on Iceland and the Azores (Portugal) as well.In Eastern Europe like Romania, hot springs were mainly artificially generated by drilling holes.In other regions, geothermal springs exhibit mostly temperatures below 50 °C or no corresponding scientific publications are available so far and were, therefore, not included in this review.  Research on thermophiles in Europe was often organized in large clusters funded by the European Union.First attempts on extremophiles in general started in 1983 with the first Biotechnology program (Aguilar 1996).The base for extremophile research was created by establishing huge European network projects \"Extremophiles as cell factories\" and \"Biotechnology of extremophiles\" with more than 58 laboratories from all across the EU including isolation of novel extremophiles and their enzymes (Aguilar et al. 1998).Moreover, two large network European projects were initiated and coordinated by G. Antranikian (TUHH), which had a significant impact on the research in the field of extremophiles and their enzymes: 'Extremophiles as Cell Factories' (58 partners including 13 industries, 1993-1996) and \"Biotechnology of Extremophiles\" (39 partners, 1997-1999).  The next chapters will give an overview on the research and developments of enzyme screening of Europe's hot springs as well as Caucasian hot springs sorted by regions.   Northern Europe  Northern Europe, including Scandinavia and the British Isles, rarely harbors natural terrestrial hot springs with temperatures above 50 °C.An exception to this is Iceland, which has a wide range of hot springs owing to its ongoing emerging volcanic generation.The scientific exploration of the biodiversity of hot springs in Iceland already started in the 1970s.   Iceland  In Iceland, hot springs are spread over the whole country.They range from highly investigated terrestrial solfataric fields and alkaline springs in the vicinity of the capital Reykjavik (e.g., Hveragerði, Grensdalur, Krýsuvík) to sequestered areas like intertidal hot springs in the Isafjardardjup bay in the northwest and Kolbeinsey ridge in the north of Iceland with an island and submarine volcanoes (Fig. 3).  First microbial analysis started with the isolation and investigation of archaea from the order of Thermoproteales and Desulforococcales (Zillig et al. 1981(Zillig et al. , 1982) ) and bacteria from the genus of Thermus and Rhodothermus on complex medium (Pask-Hughes and Williams 1977;Kristjansson and Alfredsson 1983;Alfredsson et al. 1988).Many of the gained isolates were then further investigated for their enzyme activities.Prominent examples are isolates of Rhodothermus marinus derived from various sampling sites in Iceland.Examined biotechnologically relevant enzymes not only include DNA modifying enzymes but also wide-ranging polysaccharide degrading enzymes with highest activity above 85 °C (Bjornsdottir et al. 2006).To gain enzymes from R. marinus, different screening strategies were applied.By screening genome libraries of different R. marinus strains, beta-glucanase, ligase, cellulase, xylanase, and mannanase could be recovered and recombinantly produced (Spilliaert et al. 1994;Thorbjarnardóttir et al. 1995;Nordberg Karlsson et al. 1997;Halldórsdóttir et al. 1998;Politz et al. 2000).Blöndal et al. (2001) used degenerated primers for the detection of a DNA polymerase I. Based on (partial) genomic DNA sequencing and in silico identification, an enzyme with chitinase activity could be recombinantly produced (Hobel et al. 2005a).The genome of the type strain R-10 T originating from Iceland was sequenced in 2009 which then gives further insights into metabolism and biotechnologically relevant enzymes (Nolan et al. 2009).  Beside R. marinus, many other isolated strains of Islandic hot springs were screened for enzyme activities.This includes lipases, DNA-modifying enzymes, and hydrogen production from sugars (Sigurgsladttir et al. 1993;Hjorleifsdttir et al. 1996;Hjorleifsdottir et al. 1997;Vipotnik et al. 2016).To increase the probability for identifying enzymes with desired activities, (in situ) enrichments with appropriate substrates were performed.The applied subsequent strategies to gain novel enzymes were quiet diverse.They comprise the extraction of isolates on xylan (Sonne-Hansen et al. 1993), the use of degenerated primers after enrichment with starch or chitin (Hobel et al. 2004(Hobel et al. , 2005a) ) or the amplification of consensus sequences and gene walking to determine neopullulanases (Labes et al. 2008;Nordberg Karlsson et al. 2008).Moreover, enrichments on glucose were carried out for the increase of high-temperature hydrogen and ethanol-producing microorganisms (Koskinen et al. 2008;Jessen and Orlygsson 2012;Jessen et al. 2015).  In parallel, sequencing technologies were developed, enabling diversity analysis of environmental samples for displaying the abundance of even unculturable species and comparison with other high-temperature sampling sites on Earth.In a high-temperature pool in Grensdalur (85-90 °C, pH 5), it was shown that a high number of sequences were annotated to uncultured species which emphasize the potential of metagenomic sequencing for the screening of novel enzymes (Menzel et al. 2015).Diverse Icelandic hot springs were explored with regard to their microbial biodiversity, including terrestrial volcanic hot springs, intertidal hot springs, and geothermal freshwater fluids on subseafloor (Marteinsson et al. 2001b(Marteinsson et al. , 2001a;;Hobel et al. 2005b;Cousins et al. 2018).Particularly, the diversity of archaea was studied in different Icelandic hot springs investigating general archaeal diversity, nitrification or the abundance of Crenarchaeota and Korarchaeota (Kvist et al. 2007;Perevalova et al. 2008;Reigstad et al. 2008Reigstad et al. , 2010)).Kvist et al. (2007) demonstrated the diversity potential in an analysis of solfataras and neutral springs in Hveragerdi.They observed variable diversity of archaea between solfatara fields but also within a single field indicates even the rich biotechnological opportunities for novel industrial enzymes.This was also confirmed by studies of Krebs et al. in 2014 andPodar et al. in 2020, which describe the influence of biodiversity by the formation of distinct niches due to temperature gradients in solfataras and alkaline hot springs of Iceland.Moreover, it was discerned that the more extreme temperature, pH, and sulfide concentration in a habitat is the lower the diversity was ascertained (Skirnisdottir et al. 2000;Menzel et al. 2015).  The sequencing technologies paved the way for a new era of sequence-based screening approaches to exploit the enzyme potential of Icelandic hot springs.Due to the high extent of these approaches, they were often organized in public funded projects running for several years.Amylomics was a EU funded project for robust enzymes applied in the carbohydrate industry (Zucko et al. 2013).Beside insights in microbial biodiversity, 4500 novel genes encoding carbohydrate active enzymes were identified by sequencing and microarray technology.High promising candidates were implemented in demonstration and marketing phase and patents.Another example is the EU FP7 Project HotZyme, a multidisciplinary approach processing culture-independent metagenomic datasets, metagenomes from enrichment cultures on polysaccharides, keratin and artificial polymers as well as isolated genomes and transcriptomes (Wohlgemuth et al. 2018;Koutsandreas et al. 2019).They developed an automated nucleotide amino acid sequences translational platform for systemic interpretation and analysis to gain novel thermostable enzymes of industrial interest, including carboxylesterases, lactonases, epoxide hydrolases, and cellulases.The huge amount of data of such projects are just at the beginning to be exploited and generate a valuable feedstock for future discovery of enzymes of particular demand.   Central Europe  Compared to other regions in Europe, the number of thermal springs is small, often with temperatures below or slightly above 50 °C.Although they are well known and used as spas or mineral springs, nearly no scientific publications about their microbial and enzyme content are available.Hot springs with temperatures above 50 °C are, for example, located in the Rhenish Massif in Germany or in the Massif Central region in France.In the Massif Central region, a number of hot springs were already sampled to gain thermophilic isolates.From the region Chaudes-Aigues with thermal springs ranging from 40 to 82 °C, the slightly thermophilic strain Meiothermus rufus as well as the thermophilic bacteria Caldinitratiruptor microaerophilus and Thermovenabulum gondwanense were isolated and described (Albuquerque et al. 2009;Fardeau et al. 2010;Pradel et al. 2013).Nevertheless, there are no further investigations on the microbial community and screening of associated enzymes published so far.   Southern Europe  In Southern Europe, many prominent hot springs are located.Geothermal areas in Portugal, with the Archipelago Azores, Italy, and Greece are particularly well investigated concerning their microbial diversity, isolates, and enzyme richness.In the Balkan region, geothermal areas are known but they are often used as spas, and little scientific research regarding thermostable enzymes or biodiversity of thermophilic microorganisms has been carried out so far.Thermostable enzymes like DNA polymerase from Bacillus caldolyticus, isolated from a hot spring in North Macedonia, as well as a superoxide dismutase, catalase, and oxidase from Bacillus stearothermophilus and Thermotrix sp., isolated from a hot spring in Serbia are examples of findings from the Balkan Peninsula (Gligić et al. 2000;Popovski et al. 2017).   Portugal and Azores  Many hot springs in the main country of Portugal show temperatures below 50 °C used as spas.Sao Pedro do Sul (66-69 °C, pH 8-9), Alcafache (50 °C, pH 8), and Sao Gemil (48 °C, pH 8.6) are geothermal hot springs in central Portugal which have attracted the interest of microbiologists (Tenreiro et al. 1995;Ferreira Gomes et al. 2001;Alves et al. 2003) (Fig. 4).From these hot springs, several thermophilic isolates have been generated by filtering of water combined with classical plating techniques, including Calidithermus chliarophilus, Thermus oshimai, Deinococcus murrayi, Tepidimonas species, Thermomonas hydrothermalis, Calidithermus timidus, Porphyrobacter cryptus and Raineya orbicola (Tenreiro et al. 1995;Welch and Williams 1996;Ferreira et al. 1997;Moreira et al. 2000;Alves et al. 2003;Rainey et al. 2003;Pires et al. 2005;Albuquerque et al. 2018Albuquerque et al. , 2020)).Thermus oshimai was further analyzed for the production of a thermostable β-galactosidase (Gezgin et al. 2013).Later on, an extremely thermostable amylosucrase from Calidithermus timidus was identified by sequence-based screening of the genome and subsequent recombinant production and characterization (Tian et al. 2019).Nevertheless, diversity analysis or metagenomic sequencing has not been published from these habitats so far.The only approach for gaining new enzymes directly from these sampling sites was performed by Bataillon and coworkers.By plating on arabinoxylan-containing medium, a xylanolytic Bacillus strain could be received which produces a thermoactive xylanase with highest activity at 75 °C under the given conditions (Bataillon et al. 1998).  Another spa and hot spring region in northern Portugal is Vizela, which was less intensively sampled (vent temperature 56 °C, pH 8.9, Tenreiro et al. 1995).No further microbiological investigations have been performed so far, except for the isolation of Meiothermus silvanus and investigation of several Thermus isolates revealing a Thermus scotoductus strain (Santos et al. 1989;Tenreiro et al. 1995).The geothermal area of Chaves, located at the northern border of Portugal mainland is another microbial unexplored region.Although this region holds the hottest geothermal waters on the Portuguese mainland with 77 °C discharge temperature at a drilling site and furthermore a natural hot spring with 66 °C (Marques et al. 2019), no microbial investigations have been published so far.  The most prominent hot spot for geothermal springs in Portugal is the archipelago of the Azores, located on the mid-Atlantic ridge.On the main island, São Miguel, hot springs can be found at several locations including shallow marine vents at Ribera Quente and Ferraria.The most prominent terrestrial hot springs are located in the interior of the island at Furnas geothermal area (Fig. 4).In comparison to other terrestrial hot springs, metatranscriptomic analysis of filamentous mats of these hot springs revealed dominance of Sulfurihydrogenibium azorense which metabolizes sulfur compounds under microaerophilic conditions (Hamamura et al. 2013).In addition, analysis of thermoacidophilic Verrucomicrobia methanotrophs indicated that the isolated location of terrestrial geothermal springs like in Azores promote the allopatric speciation of microbes (Erikstad et al. 2019).Sahm et al. (2013) investigated the biodiversity of two hydrothermal springs in Furnas valley by next generation sequencing with 16S rRNA gene analysis and FISH of bacteria and archaea.Related to the results of Hamamura and coworkers, chemolithoautotrophic Sulfurihydrogenibium species were identified but additionally high abundance of heterotrophic prokaryotes of bacterial genera like Caldicellulosiruptor, Dictyoglomus and Fervidobacterium was demonstrated (Hamamura et al. 2013).A high content of organic carbon sources may have caused a natural enrichment of polymer-degrading microorganisms which are a promising source for thermostable polymer-degrading enzymes (Sahm et al. 2013).  Further investigations underlined the capacity for obtaining novel biotechnologically relevant enzymes.Enrichment cultures with spent coffee ground and its different polymeric components revealed remarkable shifts in the community composition depending on the substrate indicating substrate-specialized genera (Suleiman et al. 2019).Earlier enrichments on feathers have already revealed keratinaseproducing strains (Friedrich and Antranikian 1996;Riessen and Antranikian 2001).Many isolates from the Azores have been substrate-independently gained mainly by the group of Da Costa, including slightly thermophilic strains (Albuquerque et al. 2012) and Thermus isolates (Manaia and da Costa 1991).Based on isolated strains of the Azores, restriction enzymes and a xylanase were identified (Marques et al. 1998;Welch et al. 1998).In addition, genome analysis of Truepera radiovictrix and Sulfurihydrogenibium azorense resulted in the discovery of an amylosucrase (Zhu et al. 2018) and the most catalytically effective alpha-carbonic anhydrase investigated so far (De Luca et al. 2013).  Other approaches for identification of novel biotechnologically relevant enzymes were based on the activity-based screening of metagenomic libraries.Schröder and coworkers identified an archaeal beta-glucosidase in an E. coli hosted library (Schröder et al. 2014).Remarkably, the thermophilic screening host Thermus thermophilus BL03 provides an effective alternative for successful screening for esterases from hot springs compared to conventional E. coli screening host (Leis et al. 2015).  Moreover, sequence-based screening of metagenomes opens new possibilities for host-independent screening.By this, thermostable enzymes like an alpha-galactosidase and a laminarinase were obtained from metagenomic datasets of Azorean hot springs (Schröder et al. 2017;Burkhardt et al. 2019).The probability to find high-active substrate-specific enzymes was further increased by a multi-omic screening approach.Using anaerobic enrichments in the presence of green coffee beans, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic screening approaches identified 14 promising hydrolase-coding genes.Four of them were recombinantly expressed and the enzymes were characterized as active thermostable endoglucanase, endomannanase or beta-glucosidase (Busch et al. 2021).This demonstrates that multi-omic approaches are efficient tools for the identification of novel active enzymes from hot spring environments.   Spain  Spain has a series of hot springs with temperatures below 50 °C distributed throughout the country.These are mainly used as spas.  The region of Galicia in the North-West of Spain is rich in geothermal springs.Besides a large number of thermal springs with temperature below 50 °C, hot springs like As Burgas, Lobios, A Chavasqueira, and Tinteiro in the province of Ourense show temperatures above 50 °C (Fig. 5).Several of these hot springs have been investigated as potential sources for enzymes from thermophilic microorganisms.  In 2013, Deive and colleagues analyzed the abovementioned hot springs to isolate lipolytic enzyme-producing thermophilic microorganisms from thermal spots, where biodiversity has never been investigated so far (Deive et al. 2013).With agar plate cultures, they identified 12 strains with potential lipolytic activity and, moreover, nine of them were described as true lipase producers.In addition, using submerged culture techniques, two strains from A Chavasqueira hot spring, CH6A and CH6B, showed remarkable extracellular enzyme activity.16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed highest homology with Bacillus sp. and Anoxybacillus gonensis.  In 2015 and 2019, the working group EXPRELA from the university of A Coruña analyzed Lobios hot spring toward microbial diversity and screened for novel hydrolytic enzymes (López-López et al. 2015;Knapik et al. 2019).Lobios hot spring is characterized by water temperatures up to 76 °C and slightly alkaline pH 8.2.Both biodiversity studies revealed that bacteria were predominant domains with 61% and 93%, respectively.López-López et al. (2015) used sequence-based screening and functional screening of a generated fosmid library in parallel to identify six genes encoding for lipolytic activity in total.The Page 11 of 27 5 most interesting candidate LOB4Est was heterologously expressed in a mesophilic yeast host and biochemically characterized.  For the identification of xylan-degrading enzymes, Knapik and coworkers compared open reading frames (ORFs) with BLAST and the CAZy database to retrieve potential xylanase-encoding ORFs (Lombard et al. 2014).By functional screening with an established metagenomic fosmid library comprising approximately 150.000 clones, a xylanase-encoding gene XynA3 was identified and later expressed in E. coli BL21 (Knapik et al. 2019).  DeCastro and coworkers utilized a similar approach for the identification of thermostable beta-galactosidases from the microbial community inhabiting As Burgas geothermal spring.By Illumina sequencing, it was shown that bacteria dominated the microbial community (93%) with Proteobacteria and Aquificae being the most abundant phyla, while archaea (6%) and eukaryotes (0.67%) were in the minority.Two ORFs which were similar to GH2 beta-galactosidase genes were found in the assembled reads of which one showed activity after recombinant expression.The enzyme exhibited β-galactosidase activity and high thermal stability (DeCastro et al. 2021).   Italy  Geothermal hot springs with thermophilic microorganisms and temperatures above 50 °C are spread over the whole country (Minissale 1991) (Fig. 6).Many of them are used as natural spas.The best microbially examined spring in northern Italy is an Euganean hot spring in the area of Padua, called Abano.Although it reaches temperatures of up to 75 °C, so far microbial diversity was only analyzed from thermal muds of around 50 °C with special focus on cyanobacteria (Gris et al. 2020).However, from earlier samples, several type strains have been isolated indicating a rich thermophilic microbial community with potential biotechnological relevant enzymes.This includes Fervidobacterium pennivorans with pullulanase I activity (Koch et al. 1997).The pullulanaseencoding gene was subsequently obtained by screening of a genomic plasmid library from F. pennivorans (Bertoldo et al. 1999).Moreover, Thermoanaerobacter italicus which produces thermostable pectate lyases and Anoxybacillus thermarum with potential glycoside hydrolases and glycoside transferases were obtained from Abano (Kozianowski et al. 1997;Poli et al. 2015).Another hot spring in northern Italy which attracted the interest of microbiologists is a spa in Sirmione on a peninsula of lake Garda.With thermal waters of meteoric origin of up to 69 °C, the microbial community is mainly composed of sulphur-cycling bacteria and has not been used for screening of thermoactive enzymes so far (Paduano et al. 2018).  On the western coast of the central part, the majority of Italy's hot springs are concentrated.Since Etruscian and Roman civilization, Viterbo hydrothermal area in the surrounding of Rome has been known and used as spas.The different alkaline springs have a large chemical and temperature range between 30 and 60 °C (Piscopo et al. 2006).In 1995, the microbial investigation of six hydrothermal sites started by the isolation of thermophilic amylolytic and pullulolytic Bacillus strains and anaerobic bacteria known later as Thermoanaerobacter thermohydrosulfuricus (Canganella and Trovatelli 1995).Later on, the biodiversity of Bullicame hot spring was investigated culture dependent (plate-based isolation) and culture independent (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and showed a higher biodiversity in the microbial mats compared to the water samples which was composed of aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophs as well as phototrophs (Valeriani et al;2018).Moreover, from Bullicame hot spring, the thermophilic Caloramator viterbensis was isolated and described (Seyfried et al. 2002).  One hot spot for hot springs in Italy is the area of Naples harboring multiple terrestrial geothermal hot springs, solfatara, and shallow marine vents around the city as well as on Ischia Island (Fig. 6).Menzel et al. analyzed the microbial diversity of two terrestrial hot springs in the area of Pisciarelli (86 °C, pH 5.5) and Pozzuoli (76 °C, pH 3.0).The microbial composition of both samples differs as Pisciarelli was dominated by archaea from Acidianus and Pyrobaculum species whereas Pozzuoli was mainly dominated by bacteria of the genus Acidithiobacillus.(Menzel et al. 2015).Metagenomic sequences of Pozzuoli samples were also used for in silico screening of thermostable amine transferases (Ferrandi et al. 2017).Additionally, two hydrothermal mud/water pools of the solfatara Pisciarelli with temperatures of 85 and 92 °C and acidic conditions of pH 5.5 and 1.5 were later on investigated by Strazzulli and coworkers (Strazzulli et al. 2020).The datasets of the metagenomic analysis could be nearly exclusively assigned to sequences of archaeal origin which was also observed by Menzel et al. (2015).However, the pools in this study were dominated by species of the Sulfolobales order whereby interestingly up to two-thirds of the reads had no match to known sequences in the NCBI database (Strazzulli et al. 2020).Functional classification of the ORFs revealed the highest amount for carbohydrate metabolism.The remarkably high number of carbohydrate active enzymes including glycoside hydrolases, polysaccharide lyases, and carbohydrate esterases may be caused by rich vegetation around the hot springs (Strazzulli et al. 2017).Altogether, the findings exhibit these hot springs as valuable resources for novel thermostable enzymes of biotechnological interest.Moreover, many microbial isolates were gained from the Pisciarelli area which are interesting candidates for biotechnological applications.One famous example is Saccharolobus solfataricus also known as Sulfolobus solfataricus from which many different biotechnologically relevant enzymes were screened by cultivation experiments or in silico genome analysis including thermostable polymerase, proteases, esterase/ lipases, aldolase, lactonase, and various glycoside hydrolases (McDonald et al. 2006;Rémy et al. 2016;Quehenberger et al. 2017;Curci et al. 2021).Another interesting example is the discovery of a new α-glucosidase from an unknown hyperthermophilic archaeon characterized by a temperature optimum of 95 °C by a combination of a culture-dependent approach and metagenomics (Iacono et al. 2022).  However, due to geothermal activity, the Pisciarelli region is subject to ongoing changes influencing the microbial community composition by temperature, pH, and in situ chemistry.Iacono and coworkers analyzed three newly formed sampling sites and demonstrated their differences in biodiversity and composition of carbohydrate active enzymes indicating the unexplored potential of this area (Iacono et al. 2020).The influence of earthquakes on the microbial community was also the subject of a study on Ischia Island Page 13 of 27 5 with its manyfold hot springs next to Naples.Although the autochthone thermophilic community of the hot spring was augmented by bacteria from soil, sediments, sea, freshwater, and wastewaters, the conditions have not changed and a natural restoration process to the original community was observed after a few months (Valeriani et al. 2020).  One of the best examined microbial hot spots in whole Europe is Vulcano Island as part of the Aeolian archipelago in the southern part of Italy.For decades, microbiologists have analyzed the thermophilic microorganisms of the hydrothermal system and gained many thermophilic marine isolates.This resulted in an impressive number of isolates.One of the best studied hyperthermophilic species is Pyrococcus furiosus which type strain Vc 1 was isolated already in the 1980s from a submarine solfataric field in a depth between 2 and 10 m (Fiala and Stetter 1986).Many other isolates of the order Thermococcales were gained in the following years from the shallow marine vents of Vulcano Island.The enzyme potential of Thermococcales is huge and many thermostable enzymes have been characterized for biotechnological application fields exhausting a large portion of it.An extensive overview about these DNA polymerases, carbohydrate and protein hydrolases and many other enzymes relevant for biocatalysis is given by Schut et al. (2014).Methods for enzyme identification from Thermococcales isolates range from classical activity-based screening of genomic libraries in E. coli to restriction-independent cloning of a gene expression library based on the genome sequence of P. furiosus (Yuan et al. 2015).  Another industrial relevant isolate gained from geothermally heated marine sediments from Vulcano Island is the type strain Thermotoga maritima MSB8, which produces enzymes for the degradation of diverse polysaccharides (Conners et al. 2006).Among all thermophilic genomes sequenced so far, the genome of T. maritima possesses with 7% the highest proportion of glycoside hydrolases (Chhabra et al. 2002;Sadaqat et al. 2021).As for many other isolates, genome sequencing of T. maritima has opened a new era for sequence-based enzyme discovery, for example coming up with thermostable esterase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and cellulase/mannanase (Levisson et al. 2007;Myung et al. 2010;Sadaqat et al. 2021).  After the great era of gaining microbial isolates from Vulcano Island, the focus switched to the exploration of the microbial consortia to investigate even unculturable microorganisms.As already expected from the huge amounts of isolated strains, metagenomic analyses confirmed the rich biodiversity of thermophilic microorganisms in the area of Vulcano Island.The microbial analysis of La Fozza crater with fumaroles and comparison with other sampling sites at Vulcano Island indicated a potential correlation between the microbiome and the emitted gas composition (Fagorzi et al. 2019).However, the best studied site of Vulcano Island is the hydrothermal area in Levante Bay which was investigated at multiple sites by next generation sequencing (Antranikian et al. 2017;Fagorzi et al. 2019).Moreover, enrichment cultures on cellulose were performed and revealed a shifted community with high abundance of archaea and the presence of Paleococcus and Thermococcus species compared to the original samples (Antranikian et al. 2017).Surprisingly, the abundance of Thermotoga species which could not be detected in the original sample underlines the relevance of enrichment cultures for gaining substrate-specific enzymes from environmental samples.A culture-independent screening approach for novel enzymes was performed by Placido and coworkers.From metagenomic DNA of a shallow marine vent in Levante Bay, a fosmid library was constructed followed by an activitybased screening for lipases/esterases/lactamases, haloalkane and haloacid dehalogenases and glycoside hydrolases.The evaluation of positive clones revealed 200 enzyme-encoding genes with high biotechnological potential and elucidates the enzymatic diversity which is far from being fully explored (Placido et al. 2015).  Even on the neighboring island of the Aeolian archipelago, hydrothermal vents are present.Maugeri and coworkers analyzed two vents on Panarea Island and came upon a complex microbial community composed of phototrophs and chemolithotrophs.Attempts to investigate the enzyme potential have not been done yet (Maugeri et al. 2009).Furthermore, Pantelleria Island in the very south of Italy is harboring the fumarolic field of Favara Grande with temperatures of up to 111.6 °C.Two sampling sites were compared by next generation sequencing.Although the two sites were closely neighbored, their microbial communities differed significantly (Gagliano et al. 2016).These results demonstrate the microbial variety and enzyme potential for biotechnological applications of even closely neighbored sampling sites.   Greece  Due to the subduction of the African plate under the Eurasian plate, Greece harbors a variety of geothermal areas, most of them located along the coastal areas or in the form of shallow marine vents, and on islands in the Aegean Sea (Duriez et al. 2008).  Shallow marine vents provide a variety of thermal gradients and are rich in nutrients and minerals, located, among other sites, in the Palaeochori Bay in the southeast of the island Milos in the Aegean Sea (Fig. 7).First analyses of thermophilic bacterial consortia around shallow marine vents in the Palaeochori Bay started in 1999 with a cultivation-based approach and molecular methods such as DGGE analysis of amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments 5 Page 14 of 27 (Sievert et al. 1999).The first isolated microorganisms of said shallow marine vent system were the hyperthermophilic archaea Thermococcus aegaeicus and Staphylothermus hellenicus growing optimally at 90 °C and 85 °C, respectively (Arab et al. 2000).Furthermore, Sievert and Kuever isolated the thermophilic sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfacium hydrothermale from heated sediment of the same shallow marine vent system (Sievert and Kuever 2000).  Greece is a country rich in terrestrial hot springs, although most exhibit temperatures below 50 °C.The Polichnitos hot spring on the island of Lesvos has been investigated for its microbial diversity at temperatures of up to 89 °C (Kormas et al. 2009;Mizerakis et al. 2017).The archaeal community consisted of only two phylotypes, Crenarchaeota (93.9% dominance) and Archaeoglobus fulgidus, while the most abundant bacterial phylotype was identified as Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus (Kormas et al. 2009).At the outflow of Polichnitos hot spring, 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed bacterial species commonly detected in hot springs (Mizerakis et al. 2017).However, strains related to species never observed in hot environments but in marine habitats were identified as well, indicating a unique bacterial community.Bacterial and archaeal diversity have also been investigated at Edipsos hot spring by sequencing the 16S rRNA encoding genes, resulting in the dominant archaeal phylotype Crenarchaeota (43.2%) and dominant bacterial phylotype Persephonella hydrogeniphila (61.9%) (Kormas et al. 2009).  Besides microbial diversity analyses of shallow marine vents and a few hot springs, research targeted more toward novel biocatalysts from these communities has not been performed until now.With its richness of microbial diversity, Greece harbors great potential for further investigation when it comes to extremozymes.   Eastern Europe  Eastern Europe harbors many geothermal areas, often used as spas or energy sources.Except for Bulgaria and Romania, for the majority of these hot springs to our knowledge, no publication about the microbial diversity or potential biotechnologically relevant strains and enzymes is available.Hence, Eastern Europe still harbors a great potential for the discovery of new industrially relevant biocatalysts.   Bulgaria  Over 700 springs from about 140 natural deposits can be found in Bulgaria, with cold water springs in the North and warm or hot water springs located more toward the South of the country.The hyperthermal mineral waters in the Rhodopes mountains and in the valley of the rivers Struma and Mesta, the big Rupi basin (94.2 ha) and 56 hot springs around Velingrad are among the most well-known terrestrial hot water sources in Bulgaria (Kambourova 2018).With more than 80 registered thermal springs of different geotectonic origin and physico-chemical properties, Bulgaria shows great potential for the discovery of novel thermophilic microorganisms and enzymes for industrial application (Ivanova et al. 2011).  The starting point for research on thermophiles from Bulgarian hot springs was set in 1993 by the isolation of several thermophilic Bacillus strains with lipase or xylanase activity from samples of a hot spring in South-West Bulgaria Fig. 8.With Anoxybacillus rupiensis and Anoxybacillus bogrovensis isolated from the Rupi basin and Dolni Bogrov, further novel thermophilic bacteria were characterized in the early 2000s (Derekova et al. 2007;Atanassova et al. 2008).  In 2011, attention shifted more toward microbial diversity, and hence the unseen potential of hot springs in Bulgaria, since only a small fraction of microorganisms can be cultivated in the laboratory.While some studies focused primarily on archaeal diversity, others were studying the diversity of bacterial and archaeal consortia altogether (Ivanova et al. 2011;Stefanova et al. 2015;Strunecký et al. 2019).With a culture-independent approach, archaeal diversity of a hot spring near the city Valvara in South-East Bulgaria was investigated by 16S rRNA gene analysis.35 archaeal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected, belonging to three archaeal phyla with the majority (23) affiliating to Crenarchaeota.The bacterial and archaeal diversity in two geographically separated hot springs Levunovo and Vetren Dol, South Bulgaria, was investigated by Stefanova and coworkers by sequencing the 16S rRNA and GH-57 genes of the samples.The archaeal diversity was shown to be significantly higher in the hotter spring Levunovo (82 °C) with 28 sequence types belonging to five archaeal groups from Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, while bacterial diversity was higher in the hot spring Vetren Dol (68 °C) (Stefanova et al. 2015).  Thermophilic isolates were specifically chosen for their ability to metabolize specific carbon sources such as xylan, gellan, and other carbohydrates, since at temperatures above 60 °C carbohydrate solubility is high and viscosity of the reaction mixture is reduced (Emanuilova et al. 2000;Derekova et al. 2006Derekova et al. , 2008)).The first approach was to screen samples from hot springs for microorganisms with a specific enzymatic activity through cultivationbased methods.Emanuilova and coworkers found lipase, as well as xylanase producing Bacillus sp. using this approach (Emanuilova et al. 1993(Emanuilova et al. , 2000)).Derekova and coworkers were using samples from various hot springs in Bulgaria for diversity analyses and screening for carbohydrases simultaneously (Derekova et al. 2008).A gellan lyase and a superoxide dismutase were produced by Geobacillus stearothermophilus from Sapareva banja hot spring and Bacillus licheniformis from Dolna banja hot spring, respectively (Derekova et al. 2006;Boyadzhieva et al. 2010).  Bulgaria is a country rich in geothermal areas that have been investigated for diversity and valuable enzyme producing isolates as well.Nevertheless, further investigation utilizing sequence-based approaches in combination with the already used culture-based approaches can bring out the full potential of these microbial communities and their enzymes.   Romania  In the Western Plain of Romania, over 500 drillings were made between the 1960-1980s in the search of thermo-mineral springs that could be further used as an energy source (Coman et al. 2011).The resulting drilling sites harbor a great abundance of biomats, and thus microbial diversity.  In 2011 and 2013, Coman and coworkers investigated the microbial diversity of different biomats from drilling sites in Romania.With a cultivation-based approach, the cyanobacterial diversity from a drilling site in Marghita with a temperature of 67 °C was determined (Coman et al. 2011) Fig. 9.This resulted in eight cyanobacterial taxa with Oscillatoriales, Phormidium, and Leptolyngbya being the most abundant.Another drilling site with a temperature of 55 °C was studied using a similar approach.16S rDNA gene libraries were created and sequenced.Only a low diversity of archaea was observed with three represented taxa Methanomethylovorans thermophila, Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis, and Methanococcus aeolicus, while bacterial diversity was higher, with Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Proteobacteria being dominant (Coman et al. 2013).From the Romania hot spring Tășnad, the thermophile Anoxybacillus flavithermus was isolated and its esterase/lipase was biochemically characterized (Chiş et al. 2013).  Romania is not as rich in natural terrestrial hot springs as other European countries, but harbors geothermal areas that were used for energy production.These sites can be further investigated to deepen the understanding of its microbial diversity and use of biocatalysts for industrial applications.   Caucasus region  The Caucasus region is located between Europe and Asia, and it is known for its rich culture, diverse landscapes, and natural hot springs.There are many hot springs located throughout the region, each with its unique features and benefits.The Caucasus Mountains include the Greater Caucasus in the north and Lesser Caucasus in the south.The Caucasus Mountains formed largely as the result of a tectonic plate collision between the Arabian plate moving northwards with respect to the Eurasian plate (Reilinger et al. 1997).The Caucasus Mountains are part of seismically active Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt and has been a center of significant volcanic activity during the Quaternary period, which led to the formation of the number of high altitude (> 600 m above sea level) and mineralized geothermal springs with different geochemical properties (Karakhanian et al. 1997;Henneberger et al. 2000).Some of the studied springs have been identified as prospective sources of geothermal energy and are commercially usable for agriculture, space heating, hot water supply, and tourism (often used as spas) (Henneberger et al. 2000).The most famous hot springs of the Caucasus region are Tbilisi Sulphur Baths in Georgia, Jermuk hot springs in Armenia, Karvachar hot springs in Nagorno-Karabakh, Ganja hot springs in Azerbaijan, and Karmadon hot springs in North Ossetia-Alania, Russia.  The hot springs in the Caucasus region are known for their unique microbial diversity.The first investigation on thermophiles from Caucasian hot springs was set in 1990s by the isolation of several thermophilic Bacillus and Thermus strains from samples of hot springs located in Karabakh Plateau (Akhmedova;1991).Recently the microbiome of several Caucasian geothermal hot springs were published (Guliyeva et al. 2015;Panosyan et al.;2018a;Saghatelyan et al. 2021a;Geliashvili et al. 2021;Toshchakov et al. 2021).Despite these previous efforts, a comprehensive census of the microbial communities in whole Caucasus region is still lacking.   Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh  On the territory of Armenia, numerous geothermal springs with different geotectonic origins are found (Henneberger et al. 2000).In Armenian hot springs, the temperature varies from 25.8 to ≥ 64 °C, pH value is neutral, moderately alkaline, or alkaline in nature and have mainly mixed cation-mixed anion compositions (Panosyan et al. 2018a, b).The highest temperatures are measured in Jermuk (64 °C), Arzakan (44 °C), Hankavan (42 °C), Bjni (37 °C), and Sayat-Nova (36 °C) hydrothermal systems (Fig. 10).One of the most famous hot springs known for its natural beauty and clean air the Jermuk hot spring located in the town of Jermuk.  Nagorno-Karabakh is located in the southeastern part of the Lesser Caucasus.It is typically mountainous, embracing the eastern part of the Karabakh Plateau with the Artsakh valley, forming the great part of the Kura-Araks lowland.Numerous geothermal springs at high elevations with different physicochemical properties are found also on the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh (Panosyan et al. 2018a).Geothermal springs found on the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh are also mainly classified as springs with moderate temperature.Two of Nagorno-Karabakh geothermal springs located in Karvachar (≥ 70 °C) and Zuar (42 °C) are characterized with higher water temperature.  A majority of the hot springs found in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh are anthropogenically influenced and often used by tourists and local people for bath.Some of the geothermal springs like Jermuk and Karvachar hot springs are used for balneology for curing rheumatismal and dermatological as well as digestive disorders and physical exhaustion (Panosyan et al. 2018a).  Overall, the hot springs in the Caucasus region are a unique and fascinating natural resource.  During the past decades, the phylogenetic diversity of microbial community thriving in Armenian and Nagorno Karabakhian geothermal springs has been explored following both cultivation-based and culture-independent approaches.The studies of taxonomic diversity of hot spring microbiomes examined using DGGE, 16S rRNA gene library construction, 454 pyrosequencing, and Illumina HiSeq have revealed abundance of bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes.Archaea mainly include the phyla Euryarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Thaumarchaeota, and comprise less than 1% of the prokaryotic community (Panosyan and Birkeland 2014; Panosyan et al. 2017Panosyan et al. , 2018a;;Hedlund et al. 2013).The microbial diversity of Karvachar hot spring was represented by phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus (Saghatelyan et al. 2021a).  Several cultivation-based studies have been performed to describe novel strains/species derived in Armenian geothermal springs.Many thermophilic microbes as producers of exopolysaccharide (EPS) and thermozymes like lipase, protease, amylase, and DNA polymerase have been isolated from targeted geothermal springs.More than 22 distinct species belonging to the eight genera Aeribacillus, Anoxybacillus, Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Geobacillus, Parageobacillus, Paenibacillus, and Ureibacillus were identified (Panosyan et al. 2020).Many isolated bacilli shared 91-97% sequence identity with their closest matches in GenBank, indicating that they belonged to novel taxa, at least at the species level.71% of the isolates were found to actively produce at least one or more extracellular protease, amylase, or lipase (Shahinyan et al. 2017;Panosyan et al. 2020;Tadevosyan et al. 2022).Two active producers of EPSs, Geobacillus thermodenitrificans ArzA-6 and Geobacillus (Parageobacillus) toebii ArzA-8 have been isolated from Arzakan hot springs (Panosyan et al. 2018b).  A thermophilic spirochete Treponema sp.J25 was isolated from Jermuk geothermal spring.It showed only 95.1% 16S rRNA sequence similarity with Treponema caldarium H1 T , indicating that strain J25 potentially represents a novel species in the genus Treponema.Genomic analyses further confirmed that Treponema sp.J25 is the only known thermophilic free-living treponeme with metabolic potential for nitrogen fixation (Poghosyan 2015).  Two aerobic thermoactinomycetes with growth T opt 50-55 °C and pH opt 7.0-7.4able to produce extracellular hydrolases were isolated from Akhurik and Tatev geothermal springs (Panosyan 2019).  A gammaproteobacterial methanotroph, Methylocaldum sp.AK-K6 strain was isolated from Akhurik geothermal spring and identified based on both phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics (Islam et al. 2015).  Sediment samples from Arzakan and Jermuk geothermal springs were used to enrich nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) at 45-50 °C.It was shown that Nitrospira calida and Nitrospira moscoviensis were the dominant species in examined samples (Edwards et al. 2013).Acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic enrichment at 45 °C and 55 °C using sediments from Jermuk and Arzakan geothermal springs also were obtained (Hedlund et al. 2013;Panosyan and Birkeland 2014).  Thermophilic keratinolitic bacteria were isolated from water and sediments samples of Arzakan, Karvachar, and Zuar geothermal springs by accumulation cultures using a chicken feather as a source of carbon and nitrogen.The strains were identified as B. licheniformis, B. borbori and Thermobacillus sp., and able to hydrolyze feather after 96 h of incubation, at 55 °C (Tadevosyan et al. 2022).  A new species of thermophilic bacterium belonging to the genus Anoxybacillus named Anoxybacillus karvacharensis sp.nov.(= DSM 106524 T = KCTC 15807 T) has been discovered from Karvachar hot spring (Panosyan et al. 2021).  Recently a novel strain of Thermus scotoductus (designated K1) was isolated from sludge samples of Karvachar hot spring.The DNA polymerase (TsK1) obtained from the thermophile T. scotoductus K1 has the potential to be commercialized.The better base insertion fidelity of TsK1 DNA polymerase is a feature that demonstrates an advantage over Taq DNA polymerase and can be used in various high-temperature polymerization reactions (Saghatelyan et al. 2021b).Recently, metagenomic library was obtained from Jermuk hot spring.Sequence-based screening of metagenomic datasets let to two characterized carbohydrate active enzymes.A Jermuk-lamM gene (accesion number OK490392) encodes a putative GH family 16 laminarinase and a Jermuk-celP encodes a putative GH family 5 cellulase.Jermuk-LamM is a novel 1,3-β-glucanase as it shares only 69% amino acid sequence similarity to the endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase available in the NCBI database.For today, this is the only characterized endo-1,3-β-D-glucanase in Marinmicrobia genus.The product of the gene Jermuk-CelP is a novel 1,4-β-glucanase showing the highest 49.1% identity with the biochemically characterized endo-β-1,4-endoglucanase of Thermotoga maritima.Both enzymes have similar temperature and pH optima, being active at temperature range of 45-60 °C and pH range of 5-7.Both enzymes showed resistances to various additives and metal ions, thus are suitable candidates for a wide range of industrial applications including the production of biofuels and pharmaceuticals (Paloyan et al. 2022).  Overall, the microbial diversity of the geothermal springs in Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh is incredibly rich and diverse, and there are many different species and strains that have yet to be fully characterized.The study of these microorganisms is an important area of research that has the potential to yield insights into the evolution of life on Earth, as well as to develop new biotechnologies and medical treatments.   Georgia  Georgia is located between the Greater Caucasus in the north and the Lesser Caucasus range in the South, and has considerable resources of natural thermal waters.Over 250 natural thermal springs and artificial wells as well as spring clusters are known with water temperatures ranging from 30 to 108 °C.Mesothermal springs (with outlet temperature 30-35 °C) are mainly found in Borjomi, Tsikhisjvari, Page 19 of 27 5 Tskaltubo, and Saberio areas, while hot springs (with outlet temperature > 78 °C) are found in Zugdidi-Tsaishi, Kvaloni, and Kindgi regions (Fig. 11).The drilled wells are mainly used in balneology and as a thermal source for greenhouses (Melikadze et al. 2010).The Georgian geothermal springs are characterized by diverse chemical composition, with mineralization ranging from 0.2 mg/L (Borjomi region) to 11.3 mg/L (Aspindza region).The Georgian thermal waters have mixed cation and mixed anion ratios mainly composed of hydrocarbonate, chloride, sulfate, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium ions.All studied springs are rich in heavy metals and majority of them contain gasses such as hydrogen sulfide, methane, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide (Melikadze et al. 2010).  The investigation of microbial community structure in Georgian geothermal springs has been explored recently following culture-independent approaches.The sequence reads from the Samtredia geothermal spring (Georgia) water sample with an outlet temperature of 58 °C and pH 7.15, obtained from the whole-genome shotgun sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, showed that majority of bacterial sequence reads were affiliated with the Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria, followed by Actinobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Chlamydia, and Bacteroidetes.Archaeal sequence reads were affiliated with Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota (Panosyan et al. 2018a).  Microbial assemblages of the second studied spring, Tsaishi sediment, were dominated by Deinococcus-Thermus, Actinobacteria, and Aquificae.Zugdidi-Tsaishi hot spring is characterized by an outlet temperature of 82-90 °C and pH 6.0 (Geliashvili et al. 2021).One of the most famous hot springs in the Caucasus region is the Tbilisi Sulphur Baths in Georgia.These baths have been a popular destination for centuries, and they are renowned for their healing properties.The water is naturally heated and infused with minerals like sulfur, which is believed to have therapeutic effects on the body.  The microbial diversity of the Tbilisi sulfur spring (Georgia) was analyzed using whole-genome shotgun sequencing using Illumina MiSeq platform.The sequences obtained from metagenomic DNA showed exclusive prevalence of Proteobacteria, followed by minor phyla such as, Nitrospirae, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Chloroflexi archaeal sequence reads were also in the minority, belonging to the Euryarchaeota and comprising < 1% of total reads (Panosyan et al. 2018a).  At the genus level, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria of genus Sulfurihydrogenibium and anaerobic thermophilic bacteria of genus Ammonifex, capable to reduce nitrate to ammonium prevailed in the Samtredia, whereas the Tbilisi Sulfur spring was highly represented by chemoorganotrophic thermophilic community, belonging to Acidovorax and Polaromonas (Panosyan et al. 2018b;Geliashvili et al. 2021).  Three novel thermophile bacteria were isolated from water and mud samples of hot spring in the central Georgia villages Shakshaketi and Agara where temperatures around 82 °C are measurable (Vardigoreli et al. 2005).According to biochemical and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, isolated strains were identified as Fervidobacterium sp., Caloramator australicus and Pseudothermotoga lettingae.An anaerobic strain Fervidobacterium sp.GSH with optimal growth at 75 °C showed high ability to degrade keratin (native chicken feathers), which is a challenge for the current field of biotechnology.By following a multi-omics approach, its proteolytic system was explored, and new keratinase encoding genes were cloned (Geliashvili et al. 2021).Subsystembased functional annotation approach suggested high prevalence of genes associated with clustering-based subsystems, protein metabolism, amino acids and its derivatives, and carbohydrates metabolism in both springs.The genes for secondary metabolism and metabolism of aromatic compounds have also been detected, but with higher representation in the Tbilisi Sulfur Spring, indicating possible presence of genes of biotechnological importance in the studied thermal springs.   North Ossetia-Alania, Russia  North Ossetia-Alania is located in the southern part of the North Caucasus and separated from Georgia and South Ossetia by Greater Caucasus Range.On the territory of North Ossetia-Alania, a number of subterranean thermal reservoirs and terrestrial geothermal springs were found (Zaalishvili et al. 2015).These habitats are characterized mainly by moderate temperature (55 °C) and mineralization ranging from 1.1 to 2.1 g/L.Thermal water of the sources is used by local people as a thermal spa.  Recently microbial diversity of those springs has been investigated.In total, representatives of 50 phyla were detected with Bacteria having total dominance over Archaea.The most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidota which represented ~ 70 to 80% of the communities.The microbial community of the hot springs is significantly influenced by anthropogenic factors but is dominated by moderate thermophiles (Toshchakov et al. 2021).   Conclusion  The potential for the discovery of unique microorganisms and novel enzymes of thermophilic origin is still a long way from being exhausted.The majority of thermostable enzymes that have been isolated and characterized from European terrestrial hot springs and geothermal areas have been derived from Bacteria or Archaea.Culture-independent approaches like metagenomics and other \"-omics\" show great potential to close the gap between the unknown and unculturable microorganisms to unveil the immense magnitude of potential enzyme variants.  Even though the major hot spots in Europe such as Iceland, the Azores, and Italy have been well investigated, utilizing metagenomic analyses methods and microbial isolates, their manifold sequence data still comprise an unused treasure of enzymes.Furthermore, there is still a high number of lesser known and unexplored hot springs above 50 °C, harboring a great potential for undiscovered thermostable enzymes and microbial diversity to confront the ever-growing demand for the development of future sustainable bio-based industry.

In this paper, we focus on regression models for spatial panel data analysis, where repeated measurements are collected over time at various spatial locations. We propose a novel class of nonparametric priors that combines Markov random field (MRF) with the product partition model (PPM), and show that the resulting prior, called by MRF-PPM, is capable of identifying the latent group structure among the spatial locations while efficiently utilizing the spatial dependence information. We derive a closed-form conditional distribution for the proposed prior and introduce a new way to compute the marginal likelihood that renders efficient Bayesian inference. We further study the theoretical properties of the proposed MRF-PPM prior and show a clustering consistency result for the posterior distribution. We demonstrate the excellent empirical performance of our method via extensive simulation studies and applications to a US precipitation data and a California median household income data study.\",\n          \"EU-OPENSCREEN is an academic research infrastructure initiative in Europe for enabling researchers in all life sciences to take advantage of chemical biology approaches to their projects. In a collaborative effort of national networks in 16 European countries, EU-OPENSCREEN will develop novel chemical compounds with external users to address questions in, among other fields, systems and network biology (directed and selective perturbation of signalling pathways), structural biology (compound-target interactions at atomic resolution), pharmacology (early drug discovery and toxicology) and plant biology (response of wild or crop plants to environmental and agricultural substances). EU-OPENSCREEN supports all stages of a tool development project, including assay adaptation, high-throughput screening and chemical optimisation of the 'hit' compounds. All tool compounds and data will be made available to the scientific community. EU-OPENSCREEN integrates high-capacity screening platforms throughout Europe, which share a rationally selected compound collection comprising up to 300,000 (commercial and proprietary compounds collected from European chemists). By testing systematically this chemical collection in hundreds of assays originating from very different biological themes, the screening process generates enormous amounts of information about the biological activities of the substances and thereby steadily enriches our understanding of how and where they act.\",\n          \"Dx w d\\u0259w refers to the Black-Green Rivers confluences that made the Duwamish River in Seattle, Washington, USA, prior to the 1910s. Significant industrial activity and human-made diversions to these rivers caused heavy pollution and eliminated 97% of historic wetlands, forever altering the historic river systems, salmon runs and human and aquatic health. Today the Green-Duwamish River and Duwamish Estuary are an industrial and commercial corridor, albeit also a site of cultural significance and fishing rights for urban Indigenous and Coast Salish tribes, and home and workplace to diverse urban populations of sustenance fishers, immigrants and refugees, communities of color, and low-income neighborhoods. Using a socio-ecological and environmental justice perspective within a nature-based solution, the Duwamish Floating Wetlands Project designed and piloted four constructed floating wetland structures for two years on the Duwamish River and researched their feasibility to provide habitat for out-migrating juvenile salmon. A multi-pronged community team (community leaders, liaisons, stewards and scientists) worked alongside academics and professionals. This paper showcases the formulation and adaptation of a two-year citizen/community science program integrated into the project. We outline the frameworks, approach, outcomes, and lessons-learned of the community science and outreach program, and compiled these in a list of guidelines to provide practitioner, researcher and community insight into the value and necessity of prioritizing environmental justice, racial equity, and ecosystem needs in nature-based solutions.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":17}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["##### Output paths with evaluations\n","root_evaluation_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasci_266_NLP/266_Project/model_evaluations/'\n","file_name = 'bart_finetuned'"],"metadata":{"id":"PGdZx2RAbObY"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_bert = calculate_model_bert_scores(combined_df)\n","df_rouge_bert = calculate_model_rouge_scores(df_bert)\n","df_meteor_rouge_bert = calculate_model_meteor_scores(df_rouge_bert)\n","output_path = root_evaluation_path + file_name + '.csv'\n","df_meteor_rouge_bert.to_csv(output_path, index=False)\n","print(f'File written to {output_path}.')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Sa6MwH2lbeNI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1722189934131,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":252407,"user":{"displayName":"Summer Jane McGrogan","userId":"13310432929983339686"}},"outputId":"fc6a2529-85a8-4793-e88d-c89c1cda8eb9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Start Time: 2024-07-28 14:01:21.641345-04:00\n","Complete.
