The prominent myometrial/periuterine vessels seen in patients with LIPS are indistinguishable from the findings in those with AVMs (2) . Therefore, because it is a rare diagnosis that is fundamentally histopathological (5,7) and little discussed in the radiology literature, it is likely that LIPS also accounts for a portion of the cases of overdiagnosis (4) and unconfirmed diagnosis of AVMs. Nevertheless, AVM is still rarer than in LIPS (2,6) .In summary, when there is postpartum vaginal bleeding in a patient with normal b-HCG values and a finding of uterine hypervascular focal alteration, an endometrial component (RPOC) should first be excluded. When this differentiation is not clear, and especially when anomalous dilated myometrial vessels are detected in the adjacent areas, a diagnosis of LIPS accompanied by RPOC should be considered as a possible alternative to that of AVMs. The diagnosis of AVM can be confirmed by digital angiography, or the differentiation between the two diagnoses can be made through pathological study (1,4) .\",\n          \"The composition of municipal wastewater and sewage sludge reflects the use and proliferation of elements and contaminants within society. In Sweden, official statistics show that concentrations of toxic metals in municipal sewage sludge have steadily decreased, by up to 90 %, since the 1970s, due to environmental programmes and statutory limits on metals in sludge and soil. Results from long-term field experiments show that reduced metal pollution during repeated sewage sludge application has reversed negative trends in soil biology. Despite this Swedish success story, organic waste recycling from Swedish towns and cities to arable land is still limited to only about 20 % of the total amount produced. Resistance among industries and consumers to products grown on land treated with sewage sludge may not always be scientifically grounded; however, there are rational obstacles to application of sewage sludge to land based on its inherent properties rather than its content of pollutants. We argue that application of urban organic wastes to soil is an efficient form of recycling for small municipalities, but that organic waste treatment from large cities requires other solutions. The large volumes of sewage sludge collected in towns and cities are not equitably distributed back to arable land because of the following: (i) The high water and low nutrient content in sewage sludge make long-distance transportation too expensive; and (ii) the low plant availability of nutrients in sewage sludge results in small yield increases even after many years of repeated sludge addition. Therefore, nutrient extraction from urban wastes instead of direct organic waste recycling is a possible way forward. The trend for increased combustion of urban wastes will make ash a key waste type in future. Combustion not only concentrates the nutrients in the ash but also leads to metal enrichment; hence, direct application of the ash to land is most often not possible.However, inorganic fertiliser (e.g. mono-ammonium phosphate fertiliser, MAP) can be produced from metalcontaminated sewage sludge ash in a process whereby the metals are removed. We argue that the view on organic waste recycling needs to be diversified in order to improve the urban-rural nutrient cycle, since only recycling urban organic wastes directly is not a viable option to close the urban-rural nutrient cycle. Recovery and recycling of nutrients from organic wastes are a possible solution. When organic waste recycling is complemented by nutrient extraction, some nutrient loops within society can be closed, enabling more sustainable agricultural production in future.\",\n          \"Aims and objectives: To examine the nature and use of automation in contemporary clinical information systems by reviewing studies reporting the implementation and evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in healthcare settings.Method: PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, the tables of contents of major informatics journals, and the bibliographies of articles were searched for studies reporting evaluation of AI in clinical settings from January 2021 to December 2022.We documented the clinical application areas and tasks supported, and the level of system autonomy.Reported effects on user experience, decision-making, care delivery and outcomes were summarised.Results: AI technologies are being applied in a wide variety of clinical areas.Most contemporary systems utilise deep learning, use routinely collected data, support diagnosis and triage, are assistive (requiring users to confirm or approve AI provided information or decisions), and are used by doctors in acute care settings in high-income nations.AI systems are integrated and used within existing clinical information systems including electronic medical records.There is limited support for One Health goals.Evaluation is largely based on quantitative methods measuring effects on decision-making.Conclusion: AI systems are being implemented and evaluated in many clinical areas.There remain many opportunities to understand patterns of routine use and evaluate effects on decision-making, care delivery and patient outcomes using mixed-methods.Support for One Health including integrating data about environmental factors and social determinants needs further exploration.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3975,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Introduction  Organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) are organic derivatives of phosphoric acid, phosphonic acid, phosphorothioic acid, or phosphonothioic acids (Corbett, 1974;Espinoza-Navarro et al., 2017;Eco and Zweig, 2018). Up until now, Organophosphorus pesticides are one of the most commonly used pesticide classes in agriculture in the management of insect pests due to their high efficacy, comparatively high dissipation, and low persistence compared to other pest class pesticides (Gonz\\u00e1lez-Curbelo et al., 2012;Eco and Zweig, 2018). More often, pesticides are misused, including overdoses, adulterated formulas, and harvesting without a minimum waiting period (Herrera-Herrera et al., 2019). The extensive use of pesticides can contaminate both the atmosphere and food, leading to health problems (Sultana and Nakagoshi, 2001;Islam et al., 2009). In OPPs, extensive exposure to higher concentrations can lead to cardiovascular, nervous, respiratory, metabolic, reproductive, and even immune symptoms problems (Joshi and Sharma, 2011;Espinoza-Navarro et al., 2017). Besides, these groups of compounds are likely to change embryonic health and lead children to ADHD (Hassani et al., 2017). The toxicity of OPPs metabolites is much more toxic than the parent compound itself. Thus, OPPs are known to be the most toxic class of pesticides in insects, animals, and humans (Hassani et al., 2017). According to the USA pesticide usage database, the most frequently used OPPs are malathion, dimethoate, chlorpyrifos, acephate, naled, diazinon, methyl-parathion, dicrotophos, phorate, phosmet, and azinphos-methyl (Grube et al., 2011). In the developing world, pesticide selection is mostly older, broadspectrum, organophosphate and carbamate class, because of their acute toxicity and they are also cheaper than the newer types (Sultana and Nakagoshi, 2001 Bangladesh is a land of agriculture and many farmers cultivate vegetables in their home garden and in the field on a commercial basis (Chowdhury et al., 2011). In Bangladesh, eggplant and cauliflower are one of the healthiest, most nutritious, a widely consumed vegetable as it is available all year round and has an attractive taste (BARI, 2013;Amin et al., 2018). In Bangladesh, farmers have frequently used pesticides to ensure the quality and higher yields of vegetables (Dasgupta et al., 2007). The most alarming concern is that farmers of Bangladesh often spray hazardous pesticide like OPPs up to five to six times than the recommended dosage in one crop growing season (Sultana and Nakagoshi, 2001;Dasgupta et al., 2007). In recent years, eggplant and cauliflower cultivation have become expensive and risky for farmers and consumers due to the increased use of chemical pesticides to control pests (Srinivasan, 2008). Also, in most areas of Bangladesh, vegetables are marketed without maintaining a pre-harvest interval period. These market vegetables often contain pesticide residues due to overuse on the farm, which has adverse effects on human health (Dasgupta et al., 2007;Chowdhury et al., 2011;Nahar et al., 2020). A study found that eggplant is the most pesticide residue contained vegetable, which is the reason for the vegetable export reduction . In order to ensure consumer safety, most countries have established a maximum residue limit (MRL) and an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of pesticide residues in food items (Chowdhury et al., 2011). The impact of daily intakes of pesticide residues in food should be measured by an exposure or risk assessment.  In the present study, seven mostly used organophosphorus pesticides (acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, fenitrothion, malathion, and quinalphos) were selected to determine the level of residues in eggplant and cauliflower marketed in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. This study also aimed to assess the short-term and long long-term health risks to consumers posed by these pesticide residues.   Materials and methods   Chemicals  The standard (>99.6% pure) of acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, fenitrothion, malathion, and quinalphos were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA) via Bangladesh Scientific Pvt. Ltd. Dhaka, Bangladesh. Analytical grade methanol, acetone, HPLC grade acetonitrile, sodium chloride (NaCl), anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4 ), and Primary Secary Amine (PSA) were purchased from Bangladesh Scientific Pvt. Ltd.   Study area  The study area included five major markets of Dhaka city, the capital of Bangladesh (Figure 1). It is one of the biggest megacities with 20 million peoples and located in the central point of the country. This study was conducted by collecting eggplant and cauliflower for pesticide residues from major vegetable markets of Dhaka city. The Kawran Bazar, Mohammadpur Krishi Market, Mirpur-1 Bazar, Taltola Bazar and Jatrabari Bazar were considered for sample selection. These markets are famous for vegetables and other daily shopping in Dhaka city. These market vegetables are grown in different districts and certain parts of the neighbouring areas.   Sample collection  A total of 100 samples were collected (50 eggplants and 50 cauliflower). Ten eggplant samples and ten cauliflower samples were collected from each market (Kawran Bazar, Mohammadpur Krishi Market, Mirpur-1 Bazar, Taltola Bazar and Jatrabari Bazar) in Dhaka city. The amount of each vegetable samples was 1 kg. The samples were collected in individual polythene bags, and each bag has been appropriately labelled with the sample numbers and sources. The collected samples were transported on collection day to the Pesticide Analytical Laboratory of Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI), Gazipur. Each sample was cut into small pieces and appropriately mixed for homogeneity. Then, the chopped samples were processed at -20\\u00b0C using airtight zipper bags before the extraction and clean -up process started.   Preparation of pesticide standard solution  Pesticide standard stock solutions of acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, fenitrothion, FULL PAPER malathion, and quinalphos were prepared separately in acetone at a concentration of 1000 mg/L and stored at -20\\u00b0C until use. A mixed standard solution of 50 mg/L in acetone containing all the pesticides, as mentioned above, was prepared by adding the appropriate volume of each stock solution in a 50 mL volumetric flask and made to the volume by adding acetone. An intermediate mixed standard solution of 10 mg/L in acetone was prepared from the mixed standard solution of 50 mg/L. Then working standard solutions of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 mg/L in acetone were prepared by transferring the appropriate amount from 10 mg/L intermediate mixed standard solution into ten separate 10 mL volumetric flasks. All the standard solutions were kept in a freezer at -20\\u00b0C until use.   Extraction and clean-up  In this study, the modified QuEChERS extraction technique was used to extract and cleanup the collected vegetable samples (Prodhan et al., 2015). The chopped vegetable samples were grounded thoroughly with a blender. A representative 10 g portion of the thoroughly homogenized sample was weighted in a 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube. Then 10 mL of acetonitrile (CH 3 CN) was added into the centrifuge tube. The centrifuge tube was appropriately closed and shaken vigorously for 30 secs by using a vortex mixer. Then, 4 g of anhydrous MgSO 4 and 1 g of NaCl were added into the centrifuge tube, and it was shaken immediately by the vortex mixer for 1 min to prevent the formation of magnesium sulfate aggregates. Afterwards, the extract was centrifuged for 5 mins at 5000 rpm. An aliquot of 3 mL of the CH 3 CN layer was transferred into a 15 mL centrifuge tube containing 600 mg anhydrous MgSO 4 and 120 mg Primary Secary Amine (PSA). Then it was thoroughly mixed by vortex for 30 secs and centrifuged for 5 mins at 4000 rpm (Laboratory Centrifuges, Sigma-3K30, Germany). After centrifuge, a 1 mL supernatant was filtered by a 0.2 \\u00b5m PTFE filter, and then it was taken in a clean GC vial for further analysis.   Instrumental analysis  The concentrated extracts were subjected to analysis by GC-2010 (Shimadzu) with Flame Thermionic Detector (FTD) for the detection of OPPs. The capillary column was AT-1 (30 m \\u00d7 0.25 mm \\u00d7 0.25 \\u03bcm) was used to separate the analytes. The split mode was used for injection, and the injector and detector temperature were 250\\u00b0C and 280\\u00b0C with a split ratio: 30:0. The column temperature was programmed as follows: from 150\\u00b0C for 1 min, from 150 to 220\\u00b0C for 2 mins at 10\\u00b0C/ min. Helium was used as the carrier at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min, and as a make-up gas at a flow rate of 30 mL/ min for FTD with airflow at 145 mL/min. The flow rates of Helium and air were adjusted at 1.00 Pa, with a total run time was 10 mins.   Quality assurance procedure  The experiment was validated on parameters of specificity, linearity, determination coefficient (R2), and limit of quantification (LOQ). The specificity was determined by specific retention time on the chromatogram for specific pesticide. The linearity and determination co-efficient was calculated continuously by standard fortified solutions of each pesticide at concentration levels ranged between 0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg. The limit of quantification was calculated as the lowest detection level for each pesticide. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was used to measure the sensitivity of the method.   Health risk assessment  The acute health indices (aHI) or short-term health risk to consumer (Equation 2) was measured using the estimated short-term intake (ESTI) (Equation 1) and the acute reference dose (ARfD). The chronic health risk/ hazard quotient or long-term health risk to consumers (HQ) (Equation 4) was measured using the estimated daily intake (EDI) (Equation 3) and the acceptable daily intake (ADI). The hazard quotient (HQ) indicates a potential risk if it reaches 100%, and the higher aHI/HQ value is the higher risk. For the appropriate calculation, the ARfD and ADI values expressed as an mg/kg of daily intake for a 60 kg person for seven organophosphorus pesticides were obtained from the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) database (http://apps.who.int/pesticide-residues-jmprdatabase) (JMPR, 2004;FAO/WHO, 2019). According to FAO/WHO, the average national per capita consumption of 23 g of leafy vegetables, 89 g of nonleafy vegetables, and 14 g of fruit is an average of 126 g of fruit and vegetables per day in Bangladesh (Haque et al., 2014). The equation for calculation of ESTI, aHI, HQ, and cHI were given below:   Statistical analysis  The level of pesticide residue in collected samples was analysed and calculated in mg/kg automatically by the Shimadzu GC software. All the data analyses and calculations were made by MS Excel 2013 software.    Results and discussion   Validation of the method  In order to validate the method, recovery experiments were conducted for eggplant and cauliflower control samples. The collected control samples were cut into small pieces and stored at -20 0 C until homogenization. Homogenization was done using a fruit blender. Then, the homogenized sample (10 g) was spiked prior to the determination procedure by the addition of a mixed pesticide standard working solution to prepare the fortification levels of 0.10 mg/kg. After the addition of working standard solution in the matrix, the mixture was equilibrated by shaking and the samples were allowed to settle for 30 mins prior to extraction in order to ensure sufficient contact of the desired pesticides with the matrix. Then the samples were prepared according to the method which was described earlier. Precision in case of Repeatability (RSD r ) was determined at the fortification levels of 0.10 mg/kg. The average recoveries of the selected pesticides in eggplant ranged from 82-109% with RSD \\u22649, while in the case of cauliflower it was 80-98% with RSD \\u22648. The linearity, determination coefficient (R 2 ), and LOQ were measured in an external standard solution using the peak areas obtained by GC-FTD analysis. The linear regression equation and determination coefficient (R 2 ) values and LOQ are given in Table 1. The standard curve results showed that the linearity was excellent, with a determination coefficient of R 2 value ranges from 0.9931 -0.9998. The limits of quantification (LOQs) were 0.01 mg/kg, indicating the high sensitivity of this method. The proposed method was applied to the external standard solution for assessing its specificity. The specificity of seven selected organophosphorus pesticides was performed by comparing the retention times of each pesticide presented in a typical chromatogram obtained by GC-FTD using analysis of external added standard solution and matrix solvent (Figure 2).   Pesticide residues in eggplant  Out of fifty samples of the eggplant, six samples (12% of the total number of samples) contained chlorpyrifos residue, three samples (6% of the total number of samples) contained dimethoate residue and one sample (2% of the total number of samples) contained diazinon residue ( Table 2). All detected eggplant samples contained chlorpyrifos dimethoate and diazinon residues above the European Union maximum residue limit (EU-MRLs). In the eggplant, the most frequently detected pesticide was chlorpyrifos (12%), followed by dimethoate (6%). Among the seven OPPs, acephate, fenitrothion, malathion, and quinalphos were not detected in any eggplant samples collected from five major vegetable markets of Dhaka city. These findings are comparable to Islam et al. (2014). They collected forty-two eggplant, cauliflower, and country bean samples from the fields and markets of the Narsingdi district and were fifteen samples (over 36% of the total samples) found no OPPs . The study findings were well agreed with Hasan et al. (2017). In country bean samples collected from different Dhaka markets, they have detected two kinds of insecticides (such as dimethoate and quinalphos). Out of fifty analysed country bean samples, ten samples (20%) contained dimethoate and quinalphos residues, five of which exceeded the maximum residue limits (MRLs). Most contaminated eight samples contained dimethoate residue (Hasan et al., 2017). Ahmed et al. (2017) analysed 170 samples collected from Jessore, Comilla, Narsingdi, Tangail, Rangpur, Jamalpur, Gazipur, and Dhaka for residue analysis in eggplant, yard long bean, bitter gourd, snake gourd, pointed gourd, okra, tomato, hyacinth bean, and cabbage samples. Among the one hundred seventy samples, 21.78% were contaminated with insecticides, either single or multiple residues, in which 18.26% of samples had residues above MRL (Ahmed et al., 2017). According to Figure 3, chlorpyrifos was the most frequently detected pesticide followed by dimethoate in the eggplant samples collected from 5 major vegetable markets of Dhaka city. Out of the ten eggplant samples collected from the Jatrabari Bazar only one sample contained dimethoate residue (0.08 mg/kg). Among the ten eggplant samples collected from Mirpur-    Pesticide residues in cauliflower  Out of fifty samples of cauliflower, six samples (12% of the total number of samples) contained chlorpyrifos residue, four samples (8% of the total number of samples) contained diazinon residue and one sample (2% of the total number of samples) contained quinalphos residue (Table 3). Out of 10 contaminated samples, 9 were above the European Union maximum residue limit (EU-MRLs). In the cauliflower, the most frequently detected pesticide was chlorpyrifos (12.00%), followed by diazinon (8%). Among the seven OPPs, acephate, dimethoate, fenitrothion, and malathion were not detected in any cauliflower samples. The findings of this study can also be compared to Akter et al. (2017). They found that 22% of samples contained pesticide residues of diazinon, dimethoate, quinalphos, and chlorpyrifos residues in eggplant collected from the Mymensingh district. Among the detected OPP residues, only five samples exceeded the MRL set by the EU (Aktar et al., 2017). The present study is in good agreement with Islam et al. (2019). They found that about 12% of bitter gourd samples were contaminated with different organophosphorus pesticides (Islam et al., 2019). Figure 4 shows chlorpyrifos was the most frequently detected pesticide followed by diazinon and quinalphos in cauliflower samples. Out of ten cauliflower samples collected from the Jatrabari Bazar two contained multiples OPP residues namely chlorpyrifos (0.03 and 0.18 mg/kg) and diazinon (0.094 and 0.42 mg/kg). Among the ten eggplant samples collected from Mirpur-1 Bazar, two samples contained chlorpyrifos (0.373 and 0.42 mg/kg), and one sample contained diazinon (0.033 mg/kg). Another ten samples collected from Mohammadpur Krishi Market, two samples contained chlorpyrifos (0.525 and 0.54 mg/kg), and one sample contained multiple residues namely diazinon (0.08 mg/    Risk assessment  The mean concentrations of detected OPP pesticide residues were above their corresponding MRL levels ( Table 2 and 3). The high-level residue in the eggplant samples of some OPPs is an indicator of the recent use of chlorpyrifos and dimethoate on eggplant farms especially vegetables grown and harvested very close to the city and surrounding areas. Unfortunately, these vegetables usually get high priced because they look fresh compared to vegetables that come from distant areas. The OPPs' health risk estimated in the eggplant samples were represented in Table 4. For acute or short-term risk (aHIs) analysis, all ESTI values were much lower than JMPR's ARfD values. Besides, the highest risk came from chlorpyrifos with aHI 1.454%, followed by dimethoate with aHI 0.979%. All the aHIs were so lower than 100%, which indicates there was a negligible short-term or acute risk with the exposure to the tested pesticides via eggplant consumption.  Moreover, in the chronic or long-term risk assessment, the risk quotient (HQs) was notably higher than acute risk indexes. The (HQs) due to acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, fenitrothion, and malathion in the eggplant was 0. 025, 9.931, 0.297, 6.527, 0.148, and 0.025, respectively, suggesting that peoples in Dhaka city have no significant health risk through the consumption of eggplant since all the calculated values were less than 100%. Hence, the health risk from organophosphorus pesticide residues in cauliflower was relatively smaller and they could not pose potential toxicity to the consumer. Moreover, it should be considered that these vegetable samples were analysed directly after collection without washing. Whereas, it is a common practice in Bangladesh to wash vegetable after buying and most of them also peeled and cooked before consumption. These washing, peeling and cooking practices will definitely reduce the amount of pesticide residues to a significant level (Panhwar et al., 2014;Jankowska et al., 2016;Alen et al., 2017;Prodhan et al., 2018). Therefore, it is important to consider for policymakers not to destroy these contaminated vegetable products. These samples are not allowed for international trade as fresh products due to higher MRL value but face no problem for national consumption especially when one-third of our population is suffering from malnutrition and sufficient food intake.      Conclusion  This study found that eggplant and cauliflower contained organophosphorus pesticide residues at a considerable level in major vegetable markets of the Dhaka city of Bangladesh. Among the 21 contaminated samples, 20 were above EU-MRL where chlorpyrifos was frequently detected. However, the short-term health risk or acute health indices (aHI) of organophosphorus pesticide residues by eggplant and cauliflower consumption was negligible. The observed levels of pesticide residues in the eggplant and cauliflower do not pose a serious risk to consumers, but pesticide contamination in vegetables may give rise to concern. Therefore, a routine monitoring system must be established to control the contamination of vegetables with pesticides especially vegetables grown and harvested very close to the city and surrounding areas.

By this technique, gene quantification is obtained as the result of a gene expression of interest (target gene, TG) subtracted from the expression of a normalizer gene (reference gene, RG). Such quantitation can be very useful, but the results are highly dependent on the stability of the used RG for normalization. This procedure aims to minimize technical variations inherent to the quality and quantity of RNA introduced during the extraction procedure, reverse transcription and PCR efficiency [4]. Therefore, standardization of TG expression data is crucial to minimize technical variations that may obscure and affect the results of gene expression quantification [5].  For this technique, RG involved in basic cellular coding processes of protein such as cytoskeleton construction (actin), glycolysis (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-GAPDH), protein folding (cyclophilin), synthesis of ribosomal subunits (rRNA), electron transport and ubiquitin degradation (ubiquitin-UBC) are typically used. Also, ribosomal RNA are used, such as 18S and 28S rRNA. However, an ideal RG must have stable level of expression under various experimental conditions at different stages of development, tissue type and stimuli from external environment (e.g. heat and thermal stress, immunological challenge, among others) [6].  The stability of RG can be analyzed by software that use statistical tools, such as those implemented in geNorm [7], NormFinder [8] e Bestkeeper [9] programs. These programs allow analyzing expression data obtained by RT-qPCR technique and aim to assess the stability of these genes indicating the most appropriate. Normalization procedure requires suitable amplification efficiencies of both reference and target genes [2], therefore, an appropriate choice of RG are essential. Furthermore, the use of a single RG has not been recommended, in terms that it may lead to a poor standardization [7]. According to these authors, multiple RG should be used for proper gene expression quantification. Recently, the use of multiple RG has been used and recommended as a suitable approach for TG normalization in chicken [10].  Several studies have indicated suitable RG in cattle [11], pigs [12], ovine [13], goats [14], horse [15] and fish [16,17]. Also, studies have been carried out to identify suitable RG in chickens (Gallus gallus) [10,18]. However, to date, there are no studies reported that have evaluated suitable RG as normalizer under similar conditions as proposed in this study (genetic group, sex and environment).  Considering the above, we aimed to identify stable reference genes for normalization of target genes in muscle tissue from three genetically divergent groups of chicken (Peloco, Caneluda and Cobb 500 1 ) considering the influence of environment (heat stress and comfort) and sex.    Material and methods   Ethical approval   Animals  In this study, we used 36 males and females birds, being 12 chicks of each breed (Peloco and Caneluda, backyard breeds, and Cobb 500 1 , commercial line). Commercial animals were purchased a week after the birth of backyard birds in the Universidade Estadual do Sudoeste da Bahia (UESB), Itapetinga Campus, and raised under the same environmental conditions from November 2 to December 2 of 2015 with an average temperature of 26.5\\u02daC. The predominant climate of Itapetinga region is the semi-arid, in which the temperature increases during the day and decrease during the night. Nutritional diets followed the requirements of the Brazilian Tables for Poultry and Swine [19] and the feed was produced in the poultry sector of UESB (Table 1). All birds were raised in semi-open stalls and lined with wood shavings (wood chips).   Heat stress  Heat stress was provided in two stages so that all birds had the same slaughter age (30 days). First, six birds of Peloco breed and six birds of Caneluda breed were subjected to heat stress under an average temperature of 39.5\\u02daC and environmental relative humidity of 60% for one hour. In the second stage, six birds of Cobb 500 1 line were subjected to heat stress with the same conditions of temperature and humidity for 30 minutes. During the heat stress period, animals had ad libitum access to food and water.  During the heat stress, birds were constantly observed for behavioral changes, in order to avoid deaths caused by excessive temperature. The acute heat stress was determined at the moment that most of the birds (\\u00b190%) were prostrate (lying with the abdominal faced down), and with increased respiratory rate. All birds were slaughtered by cervical dislocation after heat stress period.  All control birds (six birds of each genetic group) were slaughtered by cervical dislocation at the second stage of the experiment at 4 am (local time) to ensure thermal comfort temperature (23\\u02daC).   Tissue sampling  After slaughter, muscle tissue samples were collected from the breast (Pectoralis major), placed in cryogenic tubes, identified and stored in liquid nitrogen. Samples were transported to the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory of the Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz (UESC), separated and stored in Ultrafreezer (-80\\u02daC).    Reference genes selection and RT-qPCR optimization  Sequences of ten reference genes were selected from literature [18] and used for analysis of expression stability using RT-qPCR (Table 2). To obtain the standard curve, we used a cDNA pool of all treatments aiming to optimize and calculate the PCR efficiency. We used three cDNA concentrations (15,45 and 135ng/\\u03bcl) and three primer concentrations (200, 400, 800 mM). RT-qPCR reaction conditions were set with initial denaturation temperature at 95\\u02daC for two minutes, and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\\u02daC for 15 seconds. The extension temperature was individually standardized for each pair of primer for 60 seconds. At the end of amplification reaction, we included an additional step with gradual temperature increasing from 60 to 95\\u02daC for dissociation curve analysis. Amplification of all genes was performed in duplicate in a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Results were obtained by using the Sequence Detection Systems software (V. 2.0.6) (Applied Biosystems Foster City, CA, USA) that generated the cycle threshold (Ct) parameter. The Ct values of duplicates were obtained directly from the above program and used to calculate the average Ct and standard deviation. PCR amplification efficiency was calculated for each reference gene using the following formula: E = (10^( -1/slope)-1 ) x 100 [20]. After efficiency analysis, the most appropriate annealing temperature and primer concentration were used in PCR reactions.   Real time quantitative PCR  The RT-qPCR reaction was performed using SYBR Green detection kit with GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, EUA), using specific primers. Gene amplification was performed in duplicate using the Real Time PCR 7500 Fast system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, EUA) and the results obtained with the Sequence Detection Systems program (V.  2.0.6) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, EUA) that generated the cycle threshold (Ct) parameters.  The Ct values were exported to Microsoft Excel to calculate the Ct mean, standard deviation and the standard curve for each gene. A negative control (ultra-pure water) also was added in each assay. The qPCR reaction conditions were defined as follow: Initial denaturation at 95\\u02daC during ten minutes and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\\u02daC for 15 seconds. The extension temperature between 60 and 64\\u02daC during one minute was ideal for all primers. Ct values of control wells were excluded from subsequent analyzes as well as the undetectable values.   Determination of expression stability of reference genes  The average Ct values of reference genes were used to set the input files according to each software. To calculate the stability of reference genes, four different analysis methods were used: SLqPCR [21], NormFinder [8], Comparative Ct (\\u0394Ct) [22], and BestKeeper [9]. All analyzes were performed in the statistical environment R [23], except Bestkeeper, which was analyzed in Microsoft Excel. Analyses were performed according to authors' recommendations of each tool.  The SLqPCR is a statistical analysis package for R software [23] using the method of VAN-DESOMPELE et al. (2002). To perform the stability analysis, it is necessary to transform Ct values in relative values (Q). This method automatically calculates a measure (M) of expression stability for each control gene in a given group of samples. The lower the M value, more stable, and thus recommending a pair of RG as normalizer.  The NormFinder was used as an algorithm for R statistical environment developed by Andersen et al., (2004) and provides information on intra and inter-group variability indicating the best endogenous control [8]. This algorithm indicates the expression of the most stable Table 2. Description of Gallus gallus reference genes, their specific primers used in RT-qPCR analysis and parameters derived from RT-qPCR analysis. All primers were designed by NASCIMENTO et al., (2015). gene by the lower mean values of stability (S), identifying the reference genes according to their groups of inter and intra-expression variation, obtaining a single gene with a stable expression.   GENE GENE ID SEQUENCE (5'-3') DESCRIPTION LENGTH (PB)   ACTA1  BestKeeper analyzes the variability of reference genes expression through the Ct calculation [24]. It uses a comparative Ct that calculates gene expression changes based on relative difference between an experimental sample and normalizer [25]. Data interpretation is based on standard deviation [\\u00b1CP] that should be less than 1, on standard deviation [\\u00b1 X-Fold] being less than 2 and coefficient of correlation [r], which should be as large as possible [9]. The correlation coefficient (r) and standard deviation (SD) are the main parameters to evaluate the expression of reference genes and must be large and low, respectively [9]. Furthermore, authors suggest excluding genes that have SD above 1.5. They do not indicate the importance of each measurement, leaving to researcher's criteria the decision to choose which parameter will be used. Based on these previous studies, it was decided to use only the SD to select the most stable RG.  The method of Comparative Ct (\\u0394Ct) determines the most stable gene by comparison of relative expression of pairs of genes in each sample of the treatment [22]. The stable reference genes are those that remain constant \\u0394Ct values for all tested samples. For each tool, a ranking of stability was obtained.  RankAggreg package [26] was used in R software by Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate the Spearman distance and obtain the overall ranking. This package sorts from the most stable to the less stable genes, considering the stability values and the frequency that each gene is displayed according to the algorithms of stability analysis tools (SLqPCR, NormFinder, Best-Keeper and Comparative Ct).  Ct data was converted to linear values (2 -ct ) as recommended by LIVAK and SCHMITT-GEN [27]. ANOVA was performed to identify the difference among effects and their interactions (P 0.05).   Results   Efficiency and specificity of primers  To validate the reference genes used in this study, we tested primers efficiency to check their main features prior to RT-qPCR. The annealing temperature of primers ranged from 60 to 64\\u02daC and RG expression efficiency varied between 94 and 109% corresponding to a slope of -3.25 to -3.11. The coefficient of determination values (R 2 ) were greater than 0.99 (Table 3). Primers specificity was assessed by dissociation curve, which showed only one peak indicating that no primer dimer was detected, presenting excellent performance (Fig 1).   Descriptive statistics of reference genes  Ct values < 29 are strong positive reactions indicating abundance of nucleic acid in the sample, Cts of 30-37 are positive reactions indicating moderate amounts of nucleic acid, Cts of 38-40 are weak reactions indicating minimal amounts of nucleic acid [28].  Ten reference genes were analyzed by RT-qPCR. It is clear to note that there is an expression variability among the quantification cycles of the 10 genes. Based on their expression, these genes were grouped into two categories (strong, moderate). Nine genes (ACTA1, LDHA, EEF1, RPL5, UBC, HPRT1, MRPS27, HMBS, MRPS30,) showed strong expression with Ct values ranging between 12 and 29 cycles, and only one gene (TFRC) presented moderate expression, ranging from 25 to 35 cycles. Bestkeeper was used to obtain the range of variation coefficient. The lowest value was observed for MRPS27 gene (CV = 3.2%) and the highest for ACTA1 (CV = 7.8%), as showed on Table 4.   Stability analysis of reference genes expression  Aiming to cover all factors on stability analysis, data were divided into 4 groups of analysis: General group (not considering differences between genetic groups, environment and sex), Genetic group (considering the backyard breeds and commercial line), Environment (acute heat stress and thermal comfort) and Sex (male and female).  SLqPCR. According to this tool, the best reference genes for each treatment were: General,  Table 6.  BestKeeper. TFRC and ACTA1 genes obtained SD greater than 1.5 and were excluded from analysis. The most stable gene recommended by BestKeeper for each group was: General,  Table 7.  Comparative Ct (\\u0394Ct). The most stable gene pointed by Comparative Ct analysis for each group was: General, ACTA1 (SD = 0.14); Genetic group: Peloco, ACTA1 (SD = 0.16), Cobb 500 1 , MRPS27 (SD = 0.18) and Caneluda HMBS (SD = 0.14); Environment: Heat stress, ACTA1 (SD = 0.20) and Comfort, MRPS27 (SD = 0.14); Sex: male, ACTA1 (SD = 0.10) and female, MRPS27 (SD = 0.25) as observed on Table 8.   Spearman correlation between tools  In order to verify the correlation between tools, Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used by SAS 1 software. Tools were compared by the general order of reference genes. The  (Table 9).   Overall rank of reference genes  The overall ranking of the most stable RG obtained by this package is observed on Table 10. RPL5 gene expression was statistically different only between genetic groups (P = 0.0294). Nevertheless, MRPS30 and MRPS27 were not different among the studied effects. Interactions were not statistically significantly. According to these results, the normalization factor was calculated as the geometric mean of MRPS30, MRPS27 and RPL5 genes. The normalization factor was not different between breed, treatment or sex (Table 11).    Discussion  Analyses of gene expression have optimized the selection of traits of economic interest in animal breeding. RT-qPCR has been the method of choice and recommended for RG analyses in terms that it has been used by many studies in different species, tissues and treatments [11-16, 18, 27]. Recommended values of amplification efficiency were observed for all analyzed primers in this study ranging from 94 to 109%, and R 2 values above 0.99. Annealing temperature between 60 and 64\\u02daC was efficient for amplification of all genes ( Table 2). These efficiency values and temperatures differ from those proposed by NASCIMENTO et al., (2015) which used the same primers in muscle tissues from G. gallus under different treatments. This is due to different conditions in the experimental design and equipment used, highlighting the importance of performing efficiency tests for each experiment.  According to our results, MRPS27 gene was ranked as the most stable on General group, not considering Genetic group, Sex and Environment factors. In contrast to General group,   (7) 1.06 (9) 1.26 (7) 1.46 (9) 0.87 (7)  considering the other conditions (Peloco, Caneluda, Cobb 500 1 , Male, Female, Heat stress, thermal comfort), the most stable genes varied between RPL5 (Peloco), HMBS (Cobb 500 1 and Heat stress) and EEF1 (Caneluda). Besides the General group, MRPS27 gene was ranked as the most stable in terms of thermal comfort, males and females. The evaluated tools presented a good correlation between each other considering the most stable RG, except for Bestkeeper and Comparative Ct, which displayed greater discrepancy (28% of correlation), contrary to results obtained by NASCIMENTO et al., (2015). These tools use the standard deviation as stability parameter, however, Comparative Ct considers values transformed by \\u0394Ct method and Bestkeeper uses the real values of Ct [7,20,22]. The most correlated tools were SLqPCR and NormFinder (95%). A high correlation between these two tools was expected as they are the most used for analyzing the stability of reference genes, and both perform more specific calculations to determine the most stable RG.  Interestingly, for most of the tools (SLqPCR, NormFinder and Bestkeeper) ACTA1 gene was above the sixth position in the overall ranking, however, on Comparative Ct (\\u0394Ct) analysis this same gene was considered as the most stable for all analyzed factors. Comparative Ct method uses VANDESOMPELE et al., (2002) methodology, but without the same accuracy, only by comparing the expression of pairs of genes [22], which may explain the observed variation in RG ranking. Influence of heat stress in muscle tissue of chicken  As there are variations among breeds, temperatures and physiology between males and females, it is expected to occur such variations beyond statistical differences of algorithms. MRPS27 and RPL5 genes remained the most stable for all factors, however, due to the variation between experimental conditions, it is recommended to use a third RG (MRPS30) as a control for target genes normalization. MRPS27 and MRPS30 gene encodes the 28S subunit protein and are related to death associated protein 3 (DAP3), while RPL5 encodes a small protein that is a 60S subunit component and is responsible for transporting rRNA 5S to the nucleolus [29].  Results presented in this study point to different RG than those observed by NASCI-MENTO et al. (2015), which indicated HMBS and HPRT1 genes, among the same pairs of primer, as the most stable to be used as normalizers for gene expression studies in chickens. However, in agreement to NASCIMENTO et al. (2015), our results showed that TFRC gene remains the worst among all tested genes for all categories, except for Cobb 500 1 animals and heat stress environment, and thus not recommended as normalizer. These different results are due the difference between environments and genetic groups, reinforcing the importance of stability analysis study before any experiment aiming to analyze the expression of target genes for certain treatment. Influence of heat stress in muscle tissue of chicken  The importance in choosing ideal reference genes is reflected in the normalization of the expression of interest genes. Furthermore, the use of a non-stable reference gene may negatively affect the results of Fold-Change on the \\u0394\\u0394CT calculation [27], leading to a misinterpretation of the results. The three reference genes most stable in this study are suitable to normalize gene expression data from different genetic groups of chicken that exhibited divergent behavior, as induced by heat stress. Therefore, these genes must be calculated as a normalization factor as the geometrical mean of selected RG and may be applicable for data normalization in a wide range of gene expression studies using different chicken breeds and environmental factors.  Many RT-qPCR studies have tried to validate reference genes in different species and treatments in livestock, including cattle [11], pigs [12], ovine [13], goats [14], horse [15], birds [10,18,30,31] and fish [16,17], as well as in plants [32,33]. To date, no other study analyzing reference genes under these experimental conditions (environments of heat stress and comfort, different genetic groups and sex) in chickens are known. These results may be used to guide future studies under similar experimental conditions in G. gallus. Gene expression is the most basic level in which the genotype of an organism leads to phenotype. Furthermore, genes of interest may have a specific pattern of expression under certain experimental condition, giving a wide range of possibilities for functional studies that will allow the identification of suitable reference genes for gene expression normalization.   Conclusion  Our results indicate RG according to genetic group (Peloco, Caneluda and Cobb 500 1 ), sex and environment (heat stress and comfort) effects. For genetic group effect, the recommended RG for Peloco are RPL5, MRPS30 and MRPS27; for Cobb 500 1 are HMBS, RPL5 and MRPS27; for Caneluda are EEF1, HMBS and HPRT1. For environment effect, the recommended genes are HMBS, HPRT1 and LDHA for thermal comfort; MRPS27, RPL5 and MRPS30 for heat stress. For sex effect, there was no difference among the most stable genes between males and females, and the recommended genes for both are MRPS27, MRPS30 and RPL5.  The MRPS27, RPL5 and MRPS30 genes remained stable among all analyzed factors and may be recommended for normalization of gene expression data in RT-qPCR studies of breast muscle tissue of chickens from different genetic groups and sex under heat stress conditions. These three genes must be used as a normalization factor calculated by geometric mean to be used in the normalization of target genes.

Contrary to other living things, humans take their environments under control with technologies they develop (\\u00c7epel, 2008).Hence, in order to meet their gradually increasing requirements, they continue to affect E-mail: sgulec@uludag.edu.tr.Tel: (+90) 532 5114220.  Authors agree that this article remain permanently open access under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 International License natural life negatively and use up natural resources rapidly and unconsciously.Rapid population growth, too, gives acceleration to this destruction (Erentay and Erdo\\u011fan, 2009).Together with industrialization, many countries accepted nature as an endless resource but it was too late when they realized that it would be destroyed forever and never come back to its previous state (Nazl\\u0131o\\u011flu, 1993).  However, having faced with some heavy environmental problems, our country became aware of the importance of this issue, though it was late.Then, it added the topic of environment to the new education programs accepted in 2004 with the aim of training environmentally-sensitive citizens.In the 4 th Environment Council held by the Ministry of Environment in Izmir in 2000, it was emphasized that environmental education given in our country was insufficient.That is why, with the aim of having preschool children acquire a love of nature and develop positive attitudes and behaviors towards environment, environment-themed topics were included in the programs starting from this educational stage within the framework of the cooperation with the Ministry of National Education.In this way, by using technology and practicing such matters as love of nature, children were to acquire an ecological viewpoint and the logic of ecosystem starting from the primary education age in all the formal education levels (Environment and Human, 2001).  The awareness of nature to be made to acquire in the childhood period is closely related to the nature education to be given in the socialization process.In this direction, when the actual state is looked in, it is observed that the concepts of nature education and environmental education or those of \\\"nature\\\" and \\\"environment\\\" are used interchangeably.This was also seen in the examination of the dissertations written on the subject matter (\\u00d6zg\\u00fcner et al., 2007).  Environmental awareness develops with mutual interaction of various factors parallel to personality development.In the development of environmental sensitivity, the family, educational institutions, mass communication means and non-governmental organizations have important roles.Environmental sensitivity, in other words, environmental awareness, includes a dynamic structure which can develop throughout life.That is to say, it is not a structure which is formed in a period of our life and does not change at all later, but a structure which is shaped, developed and sometimes might be regressed by effects coming both from the person itself and from around the environment.In the formation of this structure, as it is with many other features, the foundation formed in the childhood years is extremely important (T\\u00fcrk\\u00fcm, 1998).  It is a known fact that educational activities are important in the approaches to permanent solutions of environmental problems.Raising individuals who are conscious of environmental problems and sensitive to the environment appears as the most effective way of solving these problems.It is necessary to inform individuals about the subject of environment and achieve behavior modification by having them acquire positive attitudes.In this context, the importance of education to be given in the solution and prevention of environmental problems is to be considered.The success in this matter is possible through the formation of positive attitudes and behaviors in the society.Undoubtedly, individuals having a negative attitude towards the environment will be indifferent to environmental problems and even continue to create problems to the environment (Uzun and Sa\\u011flam, 2006).  Attitude is a mental, emotional and behavioral reaction predisposition which individuals organize based on their experiences, knowledge, emotions and motivations towards themselves or any object, social matter or event around them (\\u0130nceo\\u011flu, 2010).Environmental education has an indisputable importance in the analysis of the environment, perception of the integrity of nature and the planet, and the acquisition of environmental sensitivity and awareness.The foundation of the environmental education is for protecting the nature and natural resources.Environmental education should not only give information but also affect human behavior.In order to achieve positive and permanent behavior modifications in individuals and have them actively participate in the solutions of problems is the basic goal of the environmental education (\\u015eim\\u015fekli, 2004).  Since education is an important tool in changing attitudes, teachers' knowing their students' attitudes towards their lessons and how to measure them can be an important factor in increasing the quality of education.And this makes it inevitable to measure and evaluate these attitudes and make studies on them (\\u00d6zgen et al., 2007).  In a study carried out with the aim of determining the effects the environmental education program carried out based on the nature experience on the primary school students' perceptions about and behaviors towards their environment, \\u00d6zdemir (2010) determined that the participant students' awareness levels related to the environmental values and the fact that they were spoilt, their concrete worries about and reactions towards the environmental problems which they were faced with and also responsible behavior tendencies towards the environment increased.Environmental education is generally examined under three headings:  1. Education given in the natural environment: It is the education by which children learn by personally interacting with nature and acquire information by doing and experiencing.Children are made to develop more positive attitudes towards their environments by personally interacting with their natural environments (playing in the mud, feeding birds, etc.).   Education about the environment:  It is the education by which children acquire information about how natural events occur.It is the educational process in which they acquire information about such matters as how rain takes place, how plants grow.   Education for the environment:  It is the education in which information is given in relation to the protection of the environment and the precautions against the upset natural balance (Kesicio\\u011flu and Alisinano\\u011flu, 2009).  Low information and awareness level which individuals have in relation to environmental problems is an important cause of these negative attitudes and behaviors leading to these problems.Of course, identification and elimination of environmental problems is possible only through recognition of them.For it is unlikely to expect individuals not being aware of the problems to be sensitive to these problems, and asking them to modify their behaviors result to them having more problems.From this viewpoint, it is considered that determining and increasing awareness levels of individuals in relation to the environment and environmental problems is one of the preconditions of coping with environmental problems (G\\u00fcven and Aydo\\u011fdu, 2012).  Education for the environment is an education aiming to modify individuals' environmental ethics, environmental awareness, environmental knowledge, environmental attitudes and behaviors in a positive way.For this reason, modification of environmental attitudes and knowledge is included among the primary objectives of this education (Atasoy and Ert\\u00fcrk, 2008).At this point, behaviors and thoughts of teachers and preservice teachers about the environment are important.Examination of preservice teachers' attitudes towards the environment in terms of various variables is the aim of this study.  In order to make individuals become knowledgeable and conscious of environment and acquire positive attitudes towards it, environment education has an important place.Student teachers' attitudes towards the environment are important in making their students acquire an environmental awareness in the future.For this purpose, answers were sought for the following questions:  1. How is the normality distribution of the participant students in relation to the environmental behavior subscale and the environmental thought sub-scale?2. How is the distribution of the findings related to the environmental behaviors of the student teachers according to gender? 3. How is the distribution of the findings related to the environmental thoughts of the student teachers according to gender? 4. How is the distribution of the findings related to the environmental thoughts of the student teachers according to branches?   METHODOLOGY  Since the study was carried out with the aim of examining student Gulec 977 teachers' attitudes towards the environment in terms of various variables, the study made use of descriptive screening.According to Karasar (2006), studies aiming to describe, explain the \\\"nature\\\" of events, objects, entities, institutions, groups and various fields are descriptive ones.Since the aim of descriptive or survey studies is to determine current situation, these kinds of studies are usually carried out in natural environments.Techniques used in descriptive studies always change names of studies.These take such names as questionnaire survey, interview survey and observation survey (Karasar, 2006).In this study, data will be obtained through the technique of questionnaire survey.   Participant  The study group was composed of 114 students enrolled in the Education Faculty of Uludag University in the spring semester of the 2014 to 2015 academic year.Of these students, 90 were female and 24 were male.52 students were from the classroom teaching department and 62 were from the social studies department.   Data collection tools  In the study, with the aim of administering to the students, the \\\"Environmental Attitude Scale\\\" was used.The attitude scale was developed by Uzun and Sa\\u011flam (2006) and consisted of a total of 27 items.Factor analysis was applied for the construct validity of the scale and the Cronbach's alpha and the Spearman-Brown splithalf reliability coefficient were calculated for the reliability of the scale.  The attitude scale was prepared two-dimensionally, namely the \\\"Environmental Thought (Opinion) Sub-Scale\\\" and the \\\"Environmental Behavior Sub-Scale\\\".The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient calculated for the Environmental Thought Sub-Scale was \\u03b1=.80 and the Spearman-Brown split-half reliability coefficient was calculated as 0.75.The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient was \\u03b1=.88 for the Environmental Behavior Sub-Scale and the Spearman-Brown split-half reliability coefficient was calculated as 0.81.In addition to this, the Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient of the general of the Environmental Attitude Scale was \\u03b1=.80 and the Spearman-Brown split-half reliability coefficient was determined as 0.76 (Uzun and Sa\\u011flam, 2006).   Data analysis  In the statistical analysis of the obtained data, the statistical package for the social science (SPSS) 20.0 program was used.To check if the data distributed normally or not, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used.It was observed that while the Environmental Behavior Scale was different, the sub-scale of the Environmental Attitude Scale showed normal distribution, the Environmental Thought Scale did not distribute normally.For this reason, with the Independent Samples T test, one of the parametric tests, was used for the Environmental Behavior sub-scale, with the Mann Whitney U Test, one of the non-parametric tests, was used for the Environmental Thought sub-scale.  The pieces of the obtained data were scored according to the 5point Likert type scale.The Environmental Behavior scale was composed of 13 items and the Environmental Thought scale was composed of 14 items.When making statistical scoring, the highest score was calculated as 5 and the lowest one was calculated as 1.According to this, the highest score to be taken from the Environmental Behavior scale was 65 and the lowest score was 13.Moreover, in the Environmental Thought scale, the highest score to be taken was 70 and the lowest score was 14.  26) differed from one another and there was skewness (2.78) and kurtosis (11.4), which indicated that the data did not distribute normally.Moreover, when the distribution graph of the sores was examined, it was observed that there was no normal distribution.   Findings related to the environmental behavior scale   Evaluation of the findings related to the environmental behavior in terms of gender of the student teachers  When Table 3 was examined, it was determined that there was not a statistically significant difference between the students' environmental behaviors in terms of gender (p>0.05).Moreover, that the female students (38.44) and the male students (38.04) score supported this result as well.   Evaluation of the Findings belonging to the Environmental Behavior in terms of Branch of the Student Teachers  When Table 4 was examined, it was observed that there was not a statistically significant difference between the students' environmental behaviors in terms of branch (p>0.05).Moreover, this means the classroom teaching students (38,80) and those of the social studies teaching students (37,98) were close to one another supported this result as well.   Evaluation of the findings belonging to the environmental thought in terms of gender of the student teachers  When Table 5 was examined, it was observed that although the score mean of the male preservice teachers (61.90) was higher than that of the female preservice teachers (56.33), there was not a statistically significant   Evaluation of the findings belonging to the environmental thought in terms of branch of the student teachers  When Table 6 was examined, no statistically significant difference was determined between the preservice teachers' score means in terms of branch.It was found that the social studies teaching preservice teachers' means (63.00) were much higher than those of the classroom teaching preservice teachers (50.94).It was also observed that this difference created a statistically significant difference between the branches towards the environmental thought (p<0.05).   DISCUSSION  When scoring the pieces of obtained data, the 5-point Likert type scale was used.The Environmental Behavior scale was composed of 13 items; the Environmental Thought scale consisted of 14 items.The items were scored from 1 to 5. According to this, the highest score to be taken from the Environmental Behavior scale was 65 and the lowest score was 13.Moreover, in the Environmental Thought scale, the highest score to be taken was 70 and the lowest score was 14.  In the category of environmental behaviors and the sub-scale of the environmental attitude scale, no statistically significant difference was found according to gender and branch.When the arithmetic means were examined in terms of gender, it was observed that the male preservice teachers had a mean of 38.04 and the female preservice teachers had a mean of 38.44.This result can be interpreted in a way that the preservice teachers exhibited a moderate level of attitude in terms of environmental behavior.When the arithmetic means were examined in terms of branch, it was observed that the classroom teaching preservice teachers had a mean of 38.80, and the social studies department preservice teachers had a mean of 37.98.This result can be interpreted in a way that the preservice teachers exhibited a moderate level of attitude in terms of environmental behavior.  Similarly, in a study carried out by Uzun and Sa\\u011flam (2007) entitled \\\"Effects of the Course of \\\"Environment and Human\\\" and Voluntary Environmental Agencies on Secondary School Students' Knowledge and Attitudes towards the Environment\\\", no significant difference was found between the secondary school students' environmental attitudes.In their study entitled \\\"Views of Elementary and Middle School Turkish Students toward Environmental Issues\\\", Y\\u0131lmaz et al. (2004) found that the elementary and middle school students' attitudes towards the environment differed in terms of gender and this difference was in favor of the female students.In their study aiming to develop a valid and reliable awareness scale in order to determine preservice teachers' awareness levels related to environmental problems and reveal science preservice teachers' awareness levels related to environmental problems, G\\u00fcven and Aydo\\u011fdu (2012) determined that the preservice teachers' awareness levels differed according to the items included in the scale and were below the required level.  In the category of environmental thought and the subscale of the environmental attitude scale, it was observed that while no statistically significant difference was found on the basis of gender, there was significant difference on the basis of branch.When the arithmetic means were examined in terms of gender, it was observed that the male preservice teachers had a mean of 61.90 and the female preservice teachers had a mean of 56.33.This result can be interpreted in a way that the preservice teachers exhibited a high level of attitude in terms of environmental thought.In their study entitled \\\"Environmental Attitudes of Young People in Turkey:  Effects of School Type and Gender\\\", Tuncer et al. (2005) found that the secondary school students' environmental attitudes differed statistically in terms of gender and this difference was in favor of the female students.When the arithmetic means were examined in terms of branch, it was observed that the classroom teaching preservice teachers had a mean of 50.94, and the social studies preservice teachers had a mean of 63.00.This result can be interpreted in a way that the preservice teachers exhibited a high level of attitude in terms of environmental thought.However, when it is interpreted statistically, it can be considered that the social studies preservice teachers were more sensitive on the basis of environmental thought.  When the preservice teachers' attitudes towards environmental behavior and environmental thought were compared, it was observed in the obtained findings that they exhibited a high level of attitude towards environmental thought but a moderate level of attitude towards environmental behavior.In their study aiming to determine the attitudes and sensitivities of the students enrolled in different academic fields of Adnan Menderes University towards environmental problems and factors affecting these, Ek et al. (2009) found that although 85.3% of the students reported that they were sensitive to environmental problems and 86.5% of them stated that they were not a member of any related associations.In the light of the data obtained in the study entitled \\\"Examination of Preservice Teachers' Attitudes towards Environment according to Various Variables\\\", the following suggestions can be made:  1.According to the research results, it can be stated that although the male preservice teachers exhibited more positive attitudes in terms of environmental thought, both genders exhibited behaviors at a moderate level in terms of environmental behavior.When these pieces of data are taken into consideration, it can be suggested that various activities to increase preservice teachers' positive attitudes towards the environment should be included in their education process.2. According to the research results, although the social studies preservice teachers were observed to exhibit more positive attitudes in terms of environmental thought, the social studies and classroom teaching preservice teachers were observed to exhibit behaviors at a moderate level in terms of environmental behavior.When these pieces of data are taken into consideration, it can be suggested that, by assuming that they are more active in the education process of young children, regulations should be made at education faculties to affect classroom teaching preservice teachers' thoughts and behaviors towards the environment in a positive way.3. When the fact that environmental pollution has reached serious dimensions in the globalized world of the 21st century is taken into consideration, thoughts and behaviors related to the environment are becoming more important.At this point, when the importance of education and the teacher in the process of education is taken into account in raising individuals who are sensitive to the environment, the number of courses aiming to increase preservice teachers' awareness levels at education faculties can be increased.

a collaborative project open for the community to participate.It is a software framework containing a collection of Web Processing Services (WPS).The deployed algorithms are focusing on Earth Systems

can be used in a wide array of Earth sciences projects and workflows.The core benefit of this project is to allow the seamless use of climate services developed by a diverse network of national meteorological offices, regional climate service providers, academics, not-for-profit research centers and private industry.As governments move toward open-data policies, there will be a need for analytical services that extract value out of the deluge of information.Using an interoperable software architecture, institutions can provide both data and services allowing users to process the data

In a collaborative effort of national networks in 16 European countries, EU-OPENSCREEN will develop novel chemical compounds with external users to address questions in, among other fields, systems and network biology (directed and selective perturbation of signalling pathways), structural biology (compound-target interactions at atomic resolution), pharmacology (early drug discovery and toxicology) and plant biology (response of wild or crop plants to environmental and agricultural substances). EU-OPENSCREEN supports all stages of a tool development project, including assay adaptation, high-throughput screening and chemical optimisation of the 'hit' compounds. All tool compounds and data will be made available to the scientific community. EU-OPENSCREEN integrates high-capacity screening platforms throughout Europe, which share a rationally selected compound collection comprising up to 300,000 (commercial and proprietary compounds collected from European chemists). By testing systematically this chemical collection in hundreds of assays originating from very different biological themes, the screening process generates enormous amounts of information about the biological activities of the substances and thereby steadily enriches our understanding of how and where they act.\",\n          \"Dx w d\\u0259w refers to the Black-Green Rivers confluences that made the Duwamish River in Seattle, Washington, USA, prior to the 1910s. Significant industrial activity and human-made diversions to these rivers caused heavy pollution and eliminated 97% of historic wetlands, forever altering the historic river systems, salmon runs and human and aquatic health. Today the Green-Duwamish River and Duwamish Estuary are an industrial and commercial corridor, albeit also a site of cultural significance and fishing rights for urban Indigenous and Coast Salish tribes, and home and workplace to diverse urban populations of sustenance fishers, immigrants and refugees, communities of color, and low-income neighborhoods. Using a socio-ecological and environmental justice perspective within a nature-based solution, the Duwamish Floating Wetlands Project designed and piloted four constructed floating wetland structures for two years on the Duwamish River and researched their feasibility to provide habitat for out-migrating juvenile salmon. A multi-pronged community team (community leaders, liaisons, stewards and scientists) worked alongside academics and professionals. This paper showcases the formulation and adaptation of a two-year citizen/community science program integrated into the project. We outline the frameworks, approach, outcomes, and lessons-learned of the community science and outreach program, and compiled these in a list of guidelines to provide practitioner, researcher and community insight into the value and necessity of prioritizing environmental justice, racial equity, and ecosystem needs in nature-based solutions.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

While postulated to promote a systemic inflammatory response, limited studies have demonstrated changes in serum biomarkers related to PM 2.5 exposure. We aim to examine associations between short-term PM 2.5 exposure and commonly measured biomarkers known to be affected by inflammation among patients receiving maintenance in-center hemodialysis.Methods We conducted a retrospective open cohort study from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2014. Adult hemodialysis patients were identified from the United States Renal Data System and linked at the patient level to laboratory data from a large dialysis organization. Daily ambient PM 2.5 was estimated on a 1-km grid and assigned to cohort patients based on the ZIP codes of dialysis clinics. Serum albumin, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), and serum hemoglobin were ascertained from the dialysis provider organization database. Mixed-effect models were used to assess the changes in biomarker levels associated with PM 2.5 exposure.ResultsThe final cohort included 173,697 hemodialysis patients. Overall, the daily ZIP-level ambient PM 2.5 averages were 8.4-8.5 mg/m 3 . A 10-mg/m 3 increase in same-day ambient PM 2.5 exposure was associated with higher relative risks of lower albumin (relative risk [RR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01 to 1.02) and lower hemoglobin (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.03). Associations of same-day ambient PM 2.5 exposure and higher ferritin and lower TSAT did not reach statistical significance.Conclusions Short-term PM 2.5 exposure was associated with lower serum hemoglobin and albumin among patients receiving in-center hemodialysis. These findings lend support to the role of inflammation in PM 2.5 exposure-outcome associations.\",\n          \"Given the extensive number of empirical studies pertaining to this subject, a bibliometric study was required to create an overview of the literature on green technology and environmental sustainability.
