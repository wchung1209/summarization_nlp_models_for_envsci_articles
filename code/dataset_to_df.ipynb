This review summarizes the current knowledge about the harmful effects of high-fat/high-sugar diets, micronutrient deficiencies (folate, manganese, and carotenoids), obesity and associated complications, bacterial/viral infections, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, sleep deprivation, chronic stress, air pollution, and chemical exposure on inflammation through epigenetic mechanisms. Additionally, the epigenetic phenomena underlying the anti-inflammatory potential of caloric restriction, n-3 PUFA, Mediterranean diet, vitamin D, zinc, polyphenols (i.e., resveratrol, gallic acid, epicatechin, luteolin, curcumin), and the role of systematic exercise are discussed. Methods Original and review articles encompassing epigenetics and inflammation were screened from major databases (including PubMed, Medline, Science Direct, Scopus, etc.) and analyzed for the writing of the review paper. Conclusion Although caution should be exercised, research on epigenetic mechanisms is contributing to understand pathological processes involving inflammatory responses, the prediction of disease risk based on the epigenotype, as well as the putative design of therapeutic interventions targeting the epigenome.\",\n          \"This study examines empirically the potential relationship between the environmental altruism of a firm's decision maker on environmental quality and the level of adoption of enhanced environmental controls by the firm using the special case of adoption of solid waste management practices (SWMPs) recommended by the Ministry of Environment of Sri Lanka to the agri-food processing firms in Sri Lanka.The data collected from 275 firms by means of an in-depth interview with the environmental manager/owner were used to formulate a Weighted Environmental Altruism Index (WEAI) to estimate the degree of altruism of the manager.The Count Data Model was specified to assess the relationship between altruism and levels of adoption of SWMPs.The results suggest that the degree of environmental altruism of these mangers was relatively low (i.e.0.25, on an average, of the WEAI ranges from -1 to 1) and the level of adoption of SWMPs was very unsatisfactory (i.e.Mean 1.2 with 47% of non-adopters)  showing no significant relationship between these two factors.This implies the importance of augmenting the perspective of a firm's management beyond the profits through a collaborative action of the firm and other social institutions to make sure that the businesses will not be liable for the environment it operates.\",\n          \"Removal or modification of noxious organic impurities in waste-waters is a major challenge for environmental science.Pollutants such as phenols and their derivatives, as well as PCBs, have attracted special attention.In recent years, the possibilities of effecting direct electrocatalytic oxidations at high-area electrodes such as supported Pt or RuO 2 have been investigated.However, in a number of cases, especially with phenolic impurities, application of anodic oxidation fails to lead to continuous Faradaic oxidation currents owing to the electrode surfaces becoming blocked with polymeric oxidation products leading to auto-inhibition (\\\"passivation\\\") of the desired electrode process.Examples of such effects with phenols and related compounds are examined comparatively in the present paper by means of cyclic volatammetry and chronoamperometry.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

way the world \\\"is\\\" (facts), while humanities, social sciences, lawyers, philosophers, and theologians must determine the way the world \\\"ought to be\\\" (values), those in position of global-, national-, and local-political power make major decisions of the use (or non-use) of scientific knowledge and technology.As a result, the human being has created a non-scientifically based cultural environment that is affecting his ability to survive.In effect, cultural evolution is occurring more rapidly than biological evolution that can adapt to the changes brought about in the physical and psycho-social environments.In a pluralistic cultural world, where each society has generated a different view of human nature and different ethical values, the use, misuse, or non-use of scientific and technological advances are derived from these unscientific views of human nature.Since all life depends on limiting interacting environmental and ecological factors, it is imperative that scientific information be used to govern how to minimize irreversible effects on life-sustaining ecological factors, but also scientific information bearing on understanding human nature ought to be integrated into a \\\"global bioethics\\\".While ethical values cannot be directly derived from scientific factors, it is also true that human values or our \\\"ought\\\" cannot be maintained in ignorance or defiance of the facts or the \\\"is\\\".KeywordsGlobal bioethics, scientific concepts of human nature, genetic and environmental interactions, one health-one planet, human impact on earth's ecosystem Right now we're living in what Carl Sagan correctly termed a demon-haunted world.We have created a Star Wars civilization but we have paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and a godlike technology.That's dangerous.[E.O. Wilson, talking with Slate about altruism and enlightenment  existence might seem to be liken to a deer caught in the head lights of a car, in that the deer, being paralyzed by the moment and not being able to respond appropriately to escape the moment, fortunately, human beings have the potential ability to think about the past and imagine the future.We are not prisoners of the moment.Yet, we human beings do seem to be caught in the eye of a hurricane but unable to see what is about to happen.How can this be, when, in this age of global information exchange, every human being has seen natural and human-made disasters, such as starvation due to droughts, life disruptions due to earthquakes, floods, wars, and political repressions on human choices?It is though our ability to draw upon our ability to think about the past and to plan for a sustaining future has been clouded by some false views of the past and future.  It is a fact that current physical and chemical resources, which are needed to maintain all life on our earth, are finite or in fragile conditions.In addition, it is also true that the qualitative and quantitative nature of those resources have changed from the first day of Earth's creation to the day life first appeared.While non-human life contributed to utilizing these resources and to altering the ecosystem, the impact of non-human life on the ecosystem, on which all life depends, although not insignificant (i.e., role of phytoplanktons to shift our atmosphere from an non-oxygen atmosphere to an oxygenated atmosphere), has been minuscule, both with regard to scale and time, compared with that which has been altered by the appearance of Homo sapiens.Therefore, it can be said that while non-humans leave behind their existence some detritus and ecosystem changes, that detritus has been basically bio-degradable and life was able to adapt to the changes.Yet, human existence creates a non-biodegradable detritus, such as \\\"walls\\\" (physical structures and abstract ideas).These \\\"walls\\\", then, create and force new human existence.Today, an individual or a society finds it difficult to develop its own (personal or cultural) view of the world because those rather indestructible \\\"walls\\\" of our ancestors shaped our early socialization.Therefore, the rather obvious state of our current global survival, being jeopardized by an exploding human population, global pollution of air, water, limiting nutritional foods, miserable human existence for billions of human beings (Potter 1988), unrealistic or bankrupt ideologies, philosophical/political theories, religious theologies (Sagan 1995;Trosko 2002;Trosko 1984), and being exacerbated by natural disasters (recent tsunami in Japan), needs a new vision as to how, on one hand, to prevent the serious threat to decent human existence survival, and on the other hand, to plan for a sustainable ecology to meet an ever changing impact on our limiting physical and chemical resouces.  The paper the author is proposing is that recycling soft drink bottles, training more psychologists and ecologists, and building more high-tech military forces will not ameliorate the human psychosocial and ecological problems of today or the future (Trosko 1975).We must address the causes of this current and foreseeable human survival problem, and not waste too much of our valuable time and limited resources attacking the symptoms of what led us to this state.That is to say, we ought not to try to understand what led us to the current state of affairs, but, rather to use our current ability to analyze critically, using all of our scientific disciplinary knowledge, what really contributes to all our global problems.It is the author's fundamental assumption that the \\\"cause\\\" of our multiple, interacting global problems, resides in our head in the form of a view of human nature that is, quite frankly and factually, in conflict with our scientific knowledge of the biological basis of human beings (Trosko 2002).This view has been expressed by many other scholars, including John Passmore, who stated that:  Whitehead would have agreed, I think that it is impossible to put forward any political or moral theories without making assumptions about the nature of man.The concept or model may be awkward; it may be slippery; it may be indefinite.But since we cannot avoid employing some model of man, tacitly if not explicitly, it is important to be aware of what we are doing and to consider what implications may be latent in the models we have available for use.(Passmore 1970) Therein lays the fundamental issue, in that human beings, no longer a prisoner of biological \\\"instincts\\\" but is a \\\"designing\\\", cultural being, having created different \\\"cultures\\\" via its Diaspora from Africa to live in different physical environments.Each specific location of these human beings, in arid, temperate, and cold environments, created unique \\\"walls\\\" or worldviews/life philosophies and religions to control and guide human behavior, in order to survive in each of these physical environments.We, therefore, have to acknowledge that we live in a pluralistic world of different primitive, pre-scientific world views, philosophies, and religions to shape our moral values.Within those who claim that religion is their source of ethical decision-making, there are literally thousands of \\\"religions\\\", with 21 major formal religions among them.With about five billion people claiming to belong to one of those religions and about one billion claiming no formal supernatural or formal institutional religion to shape their ethical philosophy, there is now an obvious starting point of identifying the problem that has created the crisis in the distruction of our ecological environment.  While some argue that just because there are so many different religious and philosophical/political world views, and all seem to have very different concepts of human nature, their ethical principles and moral values are basically the same.This seems patently false and influenced by wishfully thinking in trying to defend their bankrupt view of human nature.In addition, others would argue that there is no such thing as \\\"human nature\\\" [\\\"Man has no nature; he has a history\\\" (Ortega y Gassett 1941)].Moreover, other have argued that even if humans have a \\\"nature\\\", who will determine what it is or whose religious or philosophical/political world view is the correct one.  Even more complexing, how can any view of human nature actually provide the principles to shape ethical behavior to prevent further destruction of our environment and to help shape a future that will minimize human misery and lead to a more sustaining ecological environment?However, the author makes the assumption, as others have (Rhinelander 1974;Pellegrino 1963;Geertz 1965;Cassirer 1956;Alexander 1971), that each individual holds a view of human nature, which shapes policies and practices of human intervention, and which in turn influences biological and psycho-social development.   AS OUR INSTITUTIONS DECAY, IS OUR SENSE OF RIGHT AND WRONG CRUMBLING AS WELL  It has been said that while many non-human life forms are conscious, only human beings seem to be conscious of their consciousness.So while all life forms, from single cell bacteria to bonobo apes do make impacts on the Earth's ecosystem, only humans, with their unique attributes: [(1) to have abstract thinking by creating symbols to represent concrete objects; (2) to communicate those abstractions via languages; (3) to convert those abstractions into \\\"things\\\"; and (4) to make choices as to use or not use those things, or to make value decisions], can make the kind of impacts on the ecosystem, needed for our requirements for life that can jeopardize our own existence.All of these attributes of being human, especially the latter (our ability to value) will have either short-or long-term consequence on our environment, which in turn will impact on all of us, positively, negatively, or both (Trosko 1984).  It is now well-established that the earliest life forms emerged from a very hostile environment, having to generate life-self-replicating molecules (nucleic acids) and cells from simple molecules in an environment, characterized by radiations, gravity, an atmosphere without oxygen, temperatures and molecules needed to produce energy for life.All this had to occur with a delicate balance to maintain the integration and stability of those life-assuring genetic-DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) codes, with the chance of some disruption of those DNA codes, in order to provide individuals in a population that could survive inevitable changes in the environment.It must be stated with great emphasis that all DNA, including that which codes for the human species, is subject to both genetic change (mutations) and altered gene expression (epigenetic changes).Human DNA is not immune to these changes, therefore, it is subjected to inevitable environmental changes (physical, social, and cultural).One specific example was the transition from an anaerobic environment to an oxygen-rich environment caused by the evolutionary appearance of oxygen-producing life forms (Nursall 1959).This then helped to select new forms of life that could utilize oxygen to produce energy for life.To make a long evolutionary story short, eventually the primate ancestors to the Homo sapiens occurred.   TWO COMPONENT BRAIN, ONE MIND AND MULTIPLE CULTURES  In recent times, a phase \\\"two cultures\\\" has been used to characterize what might be perceived as one of the primary root causes of contempory global problems created by human existence.In his controversial book The Two Cultures, C. P. Snow (1959) sought to find an explanation for problems caused by the inability to resolve the fundamental problem between \\\"facts\\\" and \\\"values\\\" or between the \\\"is\\\" and \\\"ought\\\" (Bronowski 1965).Traditionally, that bifurcation has been placed on those that hold a \\\"scientific\\\" philosophy as a world view and those that are shaped by a \\\"humanistic world view\\\".Understandably, both terms are not concise, making this bifurcation problematic.While there might not exist universal accepted definitions of either term, \\\"scientific\\\" or \\\"humanistic\\\", in general, science is thought to be a human, self-correcting process of expaining observations or ideas so that testable predictions can be made.Scientific ideas are not uniquely personal.There is no such thing as Chinese science, Italian science, Brazilian science, or Japanese science.A scientific fact or idea must be applicable by all and it is a socially derived acceptance of something that is applicable anywhere on Earth or the Universe, F = MA in Rome, Beijing, New York, and on Venus.  Equally important to realize is that all scientific facts are, on one hand, always incomplete.On the other end of the spectrum, a scientific \\\"fact\\\" can be dead wrong.Values, while some feel can be absolute and universal, are not necessarily tested to be \\\"universal\\\", nor they cannot be tested.  Another way to look at these complex distinctions between science and the humanities, facts and values, and the \\\"is\\\" and \\\"ought\\\", is to look at the pyschological means to generate a creative idea (fact or concept of value).Creativity is a product of the human brain, a product of being \\\"human\\\" (Bronowski 1965).Creativity is not a proprietory characteristic of either the scientific process or humanistic artistic process.It is a process of being human.While a scientist can have a \\\"leap of the imagination\\\", he/she must bring his/her feet back to the earth.On the other hand, an artist also can have a leap of the imagination, but he/she does not have an obligation to bring his or her feet back to earth.To be scientific, an idea must be tested publically, and be shown to be universally applicable until proven to be falsified.A song, poem, painting, or theological idea has no verifiable obligation to be accepted.  Clearly, one could argue that there exists more than \\\"two cultures\\\" that split human beings from one another.However, this bifurcation has proven useful to start to examine the complexities of the human condition and its relationship to human existence in a fragile ecosystem needed to maintain life.This basic assumption for this analysis brings to mind a story of Albert Einstein.  After delivering a lecture on his theory of Einstein, looked at the reporter and said: \\\"Young man, when you know nothing of the Universe, it is, indeed, complicated!However, when you begin to understand the Universe, it is meerly complex!\\\".Therefore, the C. P. Snow's The Two Cultures is now hypothesized in this Commentary, as being, not only between the scientific and humanistic world views, but between two biological entities, generated by evolution of the human being.At the root of the current problem of the \\\"two cultures\\\" is the inability of evolutionary biologists and neuroscientists to convince, at the most fundamental level, all people of the world that the human brain is composed of two very different components of the brain.Therein lays the problem.It could be within the framework of the original \\\"two cultures\\\" gap, in that it takes sophisticated education and training to understand the science behind both evolution and the biological development of the brain.For those who never had the opportunity to get this kind of sophisticated education, or for those who are unable to learn these concepts or, finally, for those who have the ability to understand these concepts but who have major philosophical barriers to the concept of evolution, a split is down the line of a scientific versus \\\"non-scientific\\\" world view.  In addition, one must take into account the two components of the human brain, the primitive or \\\"animal brain\\\" and the \\\"modern brain\\\", have made for \\\"strange bed fellows\\\".The primitive brain was selected for by constantly changing non-cultural environmental forces, and is responsible for unconscious, automatic adaptive or \\\"instinctual\\\" behaviors, responsible for biological individual and species survival.During the million of years that pre-humans survived, the environmental changes challenged the primitive brain to respond unconsciously or \\\"instinctually\\\", until the development of a new biological process that coincided with the development of the modern brain.This new brain matter was built upon, and was connected to, the genetically hard-wired neurological processes that allow these pre-humanoids to survive.Teilhard de Chardin stated:  Admittedly the animal knows.But it cannot know that it knows-this is quite certain while animals \\\"know\\\", they do not \\\"know they know\\\".(Dobzhansky 1967) This new level of the modern brain provided new processes to work with other non-brain anatomical evolutionary advances, or lack thereof walking on two legs, opposable thumbs, poor eyesight, poor sense of smell, etc. Included in these new evolutionary associated brain functions were the processes of: (1) self and death awareness and the ability to abstract; (2) translation of abstractions into symbols; (3) translation of symbols into things; and (4) making value choices with these symbols and things (Trosko 1984).  The emergence of cultural evolution from biological evolution has not been an easy or a seamless transition.Fundamentally, it is because cultural evolution or the human ability to create new information that provides short-and long-term consequences, impacts on the biological information locked in our genes, which is very slow to change adaptively.This is seen with the concept of \\\"walls\\\".\\\"Men build walls, but walls build men\\\" (Flusserr 1974).The non-human animals, which leave biological detritus, however, for the most part, it decays and has little influence on the next generation.On the other hand, the human being creates long-lived physical and abstract \\\"cultural detritus\\\", which can imprison future generations in physical and symbolic environments that restricts the survival potential and their individual potential as a creative individual or a humane civilization.As Ortega y Gasset has stated:  Man can not escape his biological evolutionary past and to a large extent can not break from his cultural past.(Platt 1972) This brain is functioning primarily on biological information, stored in the DNA of both the germ cells and somatic cells of this brain.Upon the biological appearance of the higher functional brain, which not only made the individual aware of self, but also aware that he/she is aware of self.This new brain, while connected to the \\\"animal\\\" brain, is involved in producing and storing \\\"cultural\\\" information.To be able to escape the immediacy of the present, which was the function of the new brain, allowed one to remember the past and to dream of future states.While the two brains are not just two collections of independently functioning brain cells, it has been difficult to distinguish how one brain functions might affect the other.Whether one's conscious actions that can affect the subconscious functions of the brain, as seems to be the case with meditation, or by one's providing rationalizations for one's physiological responses created by the subconscious reactions, false concepts, created by the modern brain, has led to the idea that \\\"free will\\\" actually exists, when in reality, the \\\"feeling\\\" that one has free will is actually influenced by information locked in the primitive brain that acts as a \\\"oven\\\" to influence the experience of cultural information locked in the modern brain (Platt 1972;Harris 2012).  With the new potential technology of stem cell therapy to treat various human diseases, some have claimed that diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, might be \\\"cured\\\" by brain stem cell therapy.While some stem cell therapies will probably be possible, this Alzheimer's disease, is one that will probably not be treated by stem cell intervention.The idea is informative, in the respect that it gives an insight to our individual human nature and our perception of \\\"self\\\".  Imagine if brain stem cell therapy was available, when a man at the age of 50, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and had lost all conscious perception of self and his past, friends, and family.After a clinical successful implanting of neuronal stem cells, one would not have restored his sense of self or his past memories of friends and family.Rather, the \\\"successful\\\" stem cell therapy might have restored his function to collect new experiences and store them for future use.However, while he might have regained the function of acquiring experiences, he would not recover his historically unique experiences that forged his original sense of self.He would only be a \\\"50 year old baby\\\".He would be able to start all over again to develop a new sense of who he might become.He will be a new person.  This should have a major philosophical impact on the non-scientific culture's sense of human nature.Our being or sense of self was not pre-ordained with a \\\"soul\\\", but it was created post conception.Only after our self-conscious started to acquire unique historical personal experiences in the social/cultural environments in which we find ourselves, does one develop a sense of who we are as an individual.Therefore, even with new stem cell therapy's restoration of the process of developing a sense of self, one could never re-create the historic experiences that created our original sense of self.Moreover, all of us, who continuously integrate new information into one's sense of self, have an ever-changing sense of self.Others who never have the ability, opportunity, or will to open up to new information to change one's sense of self, find themselves with a sense of living in a meaningless world.In addition, young children, who are in unstable social environments, might never receive positive signals from their environments to generate a strong sense of self.   INTERACTING MODERN BRAIN WITH THE PRIMATIVE BRAIN AND THE FALSE DICOTOMY OF \\\"FACTS AND VALUES\\\"  Today, more than ever before, the urgency of identifying the causes of chaos that is occurring on this human-occupied biosphere of Earth is too obvious.We must address the causes, not the symptoms.C. P. Snow was correct in pointing out that because of the cleavage and chasm between two cultures, the ethical systems of those, who really make the ultimate decisions to use or not use powerful scientific knowledge and technologies, are derived from non-scientific views of human nature.Given that, in our pluralistic world, most of which have access to use knowledge and technologies for short-term political/practical benefit, have different philosophical, theological, and political views of human nature, which ignore what modern sciences are saying about our human nature (Trosko 1984;Trosko 2002).  In our Western roots, it was Kant that cemented the cleavage between science and the humanities, between \\\"fact\\\" and \\\"values\\\" when he stated: Consequently, Kant seemed to have no alternative but to set up morality and religion as independent autonomous actions, having no connection with science.This occurred in Kant's The Critique of Practical Reason.This point is tremendously important because it explains why the modern human being came to the notion of an autonomous ethics and religion having no basis in science.(Northrop 1959) Human nature has both a genetic and an ever-changing and interactive cultural component.Human genetics makes human consciousness possible.Human consciousness makes possible an almost infinite number of cultural environments.However, because the genetic component of human nature is rather limited, in comparison to the conscious component, it is imperative that the cultural manifestations of consciousness (which includes our ethical and moral concepts) take into account the aforementioned realities of our human nature.  Our global problem resides in views of human nature that contradicts what modern sciences are saying about the biological/social nature of being human (Dobzhansky 1967).This has been succinctly stated many times.While one might find the suggestion that human nature can be identified by the sciences as nonsense, such as in the statement by Jose Ortega y Gassett: \\\"Man has no nature, he only has a history\\\" (Ortega y Gassett 1967), actually, this statement supports the idea that human nature is composed of the biological information in his genes, acquired through successful adaptive selection, as well as via the cultural information, he acquires in the unique historical/social history of which he is a part.This is further supported by John Platt when he stated (Platt 1966):  \\u2026 in this sense, human nature is indeed constant.Its constancy lies in its adaptability to the environments we set up. (Platt 1966: 160) James Drane (1972) has stated:  Every ethic is founded in a philosophy of human nature points toward ethical behavior.  Further, Leon Eisenberg elegantly noted the role in culture in shaping our view of human nature when he stated:  The planets will move as they always have whether we adopt a geocentric or heliocentric view of the heavens.It is only the equations we generate to account for those motions that will be more or less complex; the motions of the planets are sublimely indifferent to our earth-bound astronomy.But the behavior of man is not independent of the theories of human behavior that men adopt.(Eisenberg 1973) John Dewey also saw that the cleavage of facts and values, caused by the two cultures, will continue to create a major problem of survival.He was not implying that scientists were actually making the decisions to use or not to use science/technology, but by those who were not educated in the scientific process, in the potential consequences and in the implications of science and technology.They were using these powerful ideas and technologies for short-term pragmatic gain.  A culture which permits science to destroy traditional values but distrusts its power to create new ones is destroying itself.(Taverne 2009) This creates major problems, not only on the ecology, but on the individual's sense of meaning and their psychic world view: Max Otto (1947) pointed this out when he stated that:  The universe is run by natural forces and laws, not by moral laws.However, human societies, which live in the natural world, must live by moral laws.If those moral laws contradict or ignore the natural laws, it will be the human societies, not the physical universe, (or the global ecology) which will suffer the consequences of such defiance.(Otto 1947) In most cases, most of the erosion of every culture's historic non-scientific views of human nature, by the use of scientific information and powerful technologies, causes a \\\"psychic black hole\\\".As a result, traditional religious and classic philosophical world views become more and more irrelevant (Enis 2008).This then leads to what ought to be done, namely, a new role of how science must be taught.John Tonsor said it best when he stated:  If we are to act ecumenically, let us begin not with theology but with ethics.Let us put ethics at the center of our undergraduate curricula and stress the ethical implications of all post-secondary education, whether it is broadly humanistic or narrowly vocational.If we cannot agree on how to act, there is little hope that we shall agree on what we are to believe.(Tonsor 1974) Herein lays the major problem of the two cultures.If the unscientific views of human nature are somehow convincingly challenged by the scientific view in the non-scientific culture (the humanist intellectuals, as well as the uneducated masses), they are left with a moral \\\"psychic black hole\\\", a person without an \\\"ethical compass\\\" or a sense of purpose or meaning in life.Without the ability to understand scientific symbols and their meaning, the individual is left trying to defend the indefensible or is left with no sense of meaning or purpose.How does a non-believer live in a world of no \\\"purpose\\\".He focuses on to make his life meaningful and forgets the after life.Gunter Stent (1969) saw how this is happening even within science:  Thus we may perceive another internal contradiction in science: The innate axioms on which our brain bases its cognition of the outer world and from which springs common sense suffer ever-greater violation as the evolution of the physical research unfolds.This process causes, in turn, a progressive estrangement from the reality of that outer world, loss of psychic meaning of the insights gained into its operation, and hence weakening of the intensity of interest in probing further into its phenomena.(Stent 1969) A similar insight was stated by Arthur Koestler:  The new territory opened up by the impetuous advances of a few geniuses, acting as a spearhead, is subsequently occupied by the solid phalanxes of mediocrity, and soon the revolution turns into a new orthodoxy, with the unavoidable symptoms of one-sidedness, overspecialization, loss of contact with other provinces' knowledge, and ultimately, estrangement from reality.(Koestler 1964) As the Hubble space telescope has been readied for reaching to the beginning of time, the cosmological significance of its findings to date has failed to alter the perceptions of the \\\"common sense\\\" perception of human existence and human meaning in life for the billions who have seen the photographs.  \\\"Seeing\\\", in this case, is not believing!Lastly, Robert Oppenheimer reiterated this dilemma in Levine and Thomas' book The Scientist vs. the Humanist (Levine and Thomas 1963: 149):  To sum up the characteristics of scientific knowledge today, then, I would say that it is mostly new; it has not been digested; it is not part of man's common knowledge; it has become the property of specialized communities who may on occasion help one another but who, by and large, pursue their own way with growing intensity further and further from their roots in ordinary life.  One might use as examples of this idea, the recent \\\"discovery\\\" of the Higgs boson and the speculative \\\"string theory\\\" as a theory of everything, as illustrative of the above insights.This is truly a serious psychological problem in a world, where everyone has access to, and is affected by, powerful technologies that know no social or cultural boundaries.The creation of a virtual world by the internet will have consequences we can not imagine.This is seen vividly by John R. Platt (1966):  To know if an act is good, it is therefore necessary to know what its consequences are, spreading out as far as possible into the future.High morality depends on accurate prophecy.But the future becomes more and more uncertain the farther we look.Any prophecy has half-life or time-constant, beyond which it cannot be trusted more than any random guess.In times of revolution, the half-life is short; in times of peace and stability it is long.This is why the accepted rules of morality change toward the personal and the immediate in times of great emergency and uncertainty.There is little point in sacrificing the present good to the long-run better, if the long run is totally uncertain and is just as likely to be made worse by our sacrifice.   THE UNIVERSITY'S CHALLENGE TO BRIDGING THE TWO CULTURES  While C. P. Snow's conceptualization of the \\\"two cultures\\\" has been analyzed and criticized thoroughly from both sides of the gap, there should be no doubt that he brought important issues that permeate many, if not most, of global, human religious, philosophical, ethical, psycho-social, cultural, and ecological issues.As has been recently summarized, one of the criticism with the \\\"two cultures\\\" problem is not the ignorance in understanding the second law of thermodynamics by most of the non-scientist population of the world, but the basic understanding of how science works and of the power and limitations of what is referred to as the \\\"scientific process\\\" (There is no \\\"one\\\" technique or procedure by which a natural observation is explained in naturalistic terms so that useful and testable predictions can be made) (Snow 1964) Taverne gets to the heart of the matter when he stated:  \\u2026 science is one of the pillars of civilization and liberal democracy, as the eminent philosophers of science, Karl Popper, convincingly argued.It is, he said, \\\"One of the greatest spiritual adventures man has yet known\\\".Because science rejects claims to truth based on authority and depends on the criticisms of established ideas, it is the enemy of autocracy.Because scientific knowledge is tentative and provisional, it is the enemy of dogma.Because it is the most effective way of learning about the physical world, it erodes superstition, ignorance, and prejudice, which has been at the root of the denial of human rights throughout history, whether through racism, chauvinism, or the suppression of the rights of women.Nothing could have better illustrated the gap between cultures than the literary critic's, F. R. Leavis's view that science is concerned only with \\\"productivity, material standards of living, hygienic and technological progress\\\".(Taverne 2009) Arthur Koestler summed up this problem of the gap between the \\\"two cultures\\\", when he stated:  However, the absurd division of our society into the \\\"two cultures\\\" produced the paradoxical phenomenon that the average educated person will be reluctant to admit that a work of art is beyond the level of his comprehension; but he will in the same breath and with a certain pride confess his complete ignorance of the principles which make his radio work, the forces which make the stars go round, the factors which determine the heredity of his children, and the location of his viscera and glands.One of the consequences of this attitude is that he utilizes the products of science and technology in a purely possessive, exploitive manner without comprehension or feeling.(Koestler 1964) This is particularly disturbing when one recognizes that those in position of political power, who make decisions on the use (non-use or misuse) of scientific knowledge and technology, are exactly those who know little of the scientific values its process and of the long-term consequences on the ecology and human survival.In all fairness, so as not to be naive in blaming only the humanist population for not understanding the scientific world view, it should also be noted that even today, very sophisticated scientists have non-scientific views of human nature, from which of their values spring.While the highly educated \\\"humanists\\\", who can articulate, beautifully, some abstract rationale for ethical behavior, which might be consistent with a less sophisticated empirical ethical set of behaviors by uneducated individuals, if either ignore scientific understanding of human nature, the end result will be the same\\u2026 They both will suffer the consequences of the misuse of powerful technologies.  Mr. \\\"Buckley\\\"-well-spoken, intelligent, curious, had heard virtually nothing of modern science.He had a natural appetite for the wonders of the Universe.He wanted to know about science.It's just that all the science had gotten filtered out before it reached him.Our cultural motifs, our educational system, our communications media had failed this man (and, I might add, most of the world's population!)\\u2026He knew nothing about how science works.(Sagan 1995) Northrop seems to have identified the problem that needs to be solved when he succinctly defined the three types of theory that have separated the \\\"two cultures\\\":  There is the theory of natural sciences, from which the discovery of technological instruments, such as the atomic bomb, is derived.There is also the factual theory of social science, designating the de facto state of affairs in society.There is, finally, the normative theory of the humanities and social science, designating the humanistic and social ends, the correct or good form of social organization, not yet perfectly actualized in fact, at which we should aim.(Northrop 1959) By noting that natural science theories are always being generated, always incomplete and changeable by self-correction, this will always impact on the physical, psychic, and social worlds.The \\\"factual\\\" theories of social science are also forever changing, as human existence in a physical/ecological world is always changing.Thus, if the normative theories of the humanities and social sciences that have been \\\"cast in concrete as being absolute\\\" to shape the \\\"good form\\\" of social organization in a snap-shot of time, that describes the adaptive behavior for that particular physical/ecological world, do not change, then, human adaptability will be challenged.  As C. P. Snow had also pointed out, the problem also exists between the \\\"two cultures\\\" within science and technology (Snow 1964).This is seen most recently between the Robert Openheimer and Edward Teller on the use of the atomic bombs.Although we will never know the concepts of human nature or the world views that generated the ultimate ethical principles of either scientist, there should be no doubt that both were brilliant scientists, as far as their discipline of physics is concerned, again, this points to the \\\"two cultures\\\" within any category of disciplines or categorical grouping of people.

Potter, writing for \\\"The Interdisciplinary Studies Committee on the Future of Man\\\" at the University of Wisconsin, also pointed this out in the article \\\"Purposes of the University\\\" (Potter et al. 1970).The answer to this challenge was:  The primary purpose of the university is to provide an environment in which faculty and students can discover, examine critically, preserve and transmit the knowledge, wisdom, and values that will help ensure the survival of the present and future generation's improvement in the quality of life.  J. Bronoswski said it poignantly when he said:  The shame is theirs who appeal to other values than the human imaginative values which science has evolved.The shame is ours if we do not make science part of our world, intellectually as much as physically, so that we may at last hold these halves of the world together by the same values.For this is the lesson of science, that the concept is more profound than its laws and the act of judging more critical than the judgment.(Bronowski 1965) John Tonsor indicated:  If we are to act ecumenically, let us begin not with theology but with ethics.Let us put ethics at the center of our undergraduate curricula and stress the ethical implications of all post-secondary education whether it is broadly humanistic or narrowly vocational.If we cannot agree on how to act, there is little hope that we shall agree on what we are to believe.(Tonsor 1974) As Van R. Potter stated:  While it is true that human \\\"values\\\" or the \\\"ought's\\\" can not logically flow from scientific \\\"fact\\\" or that the \\\"is\\\" can determine which values are right or wrong (so-called \\\"Naturalistic Fallacy\\\"), it is also true that human values or our \\\"ought's\\\" cannot be maintained in ignorance or defiance of the facts or the \\\"is\\\".(Potter 1988) He coined the term, \\\"bioethics\\\" to help bridge the two cultures gap and the gap between the facts and values (Potter 1971).The essence of the conceptual breakthrough was by abandoning a pure abstract philosophical/theological rationalization of ethical principles, which ignored the human being as the ethicizing animal, living, inextricably, in a changing physical, biological, and cultural world.In effect, he postulated that one must account for the biological basis of the ethicizing animal in the ethical reasoning process, whose effect on individual and social behavior will have both short-and long-term positive and negative consequences.Later, the quotation by Roger Sperry, pyschobiologist, seems to be relevant at this point when he stated:  When subjective values are conceived to have objective consequences in the brain, they no longer need be set off in a realm outside the domain of science.The old proposition that science deals with facts, not with values, and its corollary, that value judgments lie outside the realm of science, no longer apply in the new framework.Instead of separating science from values, the present interpretation (When all the various ramifications and logical implications are followed through) leads to a stand in which science becomes the best source, method, and authority for determining ultimate value and those ultimate ethical axioms and guideline beliefs to live and govern by.By the word, science, I refer broadly to the knowledge, understanding, insight, and perspectives that come from science.But, more particularly, I am thinking of the principles for establishing validity and reliability and credibility of the scientific way as an approach to truth, insofar as the human brain can comprehend truth.(Sperry 1975) To put this concept of \\\"bioethics\\\" as a \\\"bridge\\\" between the two cultures, the formulation by Northrop could not have been articulated any better:  In other words, in a properly constructed society, the philosophy which underlies the definition of one's economic doctrine, one's political doctrine, one's religious, poetic, and artistic theory must be identical with the philosophy of the natural sciences which is determined by nothing more than the logical analysis of the experimentally verified theories of the natural sciences to bring out their primitive, ontological assumptions and their methodological and epistemological assumptions\\u2026.One tragedy of our civilization is that whereas natural science has gone forward, the separation of the departments of knowledge has obscured the essential connection between ideological or humanistic philosophy and the philosophy of natural science.As a consequence, our ideological philosophies have not changed along with changes in our philosophy of the natural sciences.Thus, we find ourselves with sets of normative ideas grounded often in outmoded philosophies or in partial philosophies which get into conflict with each other.Hence, the conflict of moral and social ideologies.(Northrop 1959) Levine and Thomas identified our task when they stated:  Our problem in our search for wisdom is to blend these two traditions in the minds of individual men and women.Many colleges and universities are trying to do just this, but there is one serious defect in the method.We pour a little of this and a little of that into the student's mind in proportions which result from mediation between departments and from the particular predilections of the deans and the president.We then hope that these ingredients will combine through some mysterious alchemy and the result will be a man educated, well-rounded, and wise.Most often, however, these ingredients remain well-separated in the compartmentalized mind, or they form an indigestible precipitate which is not only useless but possibly harmful, until time the healer washes it all away.(Levine and Thomas 1963) WHERE OUGHT THIS ODYSSEY LEAD While using the \\\"two cultures\\\" gap between the scientific and humanistic intellectuals was only a means to highlight that growing scientific and technological advances will always have impacts on all aspects of human social categories, even with scientists, within and between disciplines, it really boils down to the gap between those accepting scientific values and means of knowing and verifying ideas of the natural world, including human's biological nature and human's dependence for existence and survival in the natural world.In effect, this gap really refers to which means of knowing best gives humans the greatest chance of survival with justice and dignity.The major thesis of this exercise is that the \\\"two cultures\\\" gap is between those who accept the scientific views of human nature versus those that do not understand or accept those views.  These scientific models of human nature, e.g.:  (1) Nature and nurture view of human nature, not nature verse nurture, this view notes that all of human traits are the products of the interactions of genetic potentials locked in the DNA and the unique historical environmental factors (physical, chemical, biological, and psycho-social-cultural);  (2) Hierarchical view of human nature.This view conceptualizes that all the higher order features of human beings are \\\"emergent\\\" properties of the organization of atoms, molecules, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, mind-consciousness, self-awareness, abstracting ability, language, and valuing, in other words, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts;  (3) Cybernetic view of human nature.At all levels of the hierarchical nature of the human being, there is a feedback homeostatic system between our biology and the physical-psycho-social environment;  (4) Bio-symbolic view of human nature.Humans live not only in a physical universe, but also in a symbolic or abstract universe of his own making;  (5) Bio-cultural evolutionary view of human nature.The bio-cultural evolutionary view is that a biological evolutionary aspect of human biology is constantly interacting with the cultural evolutional changes that humans make (Trosko 1984).  It is this interaction of glacier-speed biological evolution with laser-speed cultural evolution that is creating our current global crises (Trosko 2014).  These models are scientific in that they explain the observations of the natural, biological nature of the human being, which can lead to testable predictions.In that sense, they are scientific models, in that they can be falsified a definition of being scientific.There are no \\\"supernatural\\\" components of these models.Any philosophical, humanistic, religious models of human nature, which cannot be tested or falsified and which are not consistent with the scientific model, must be viewed with great skepticism.These non-scientific models of human nature have been historically at the foundations of far too many world views that generated ethical rules and values that have suppressed the human potential.Racist, chauvinistic, and prejudiced views have been spawned from these non-scientific views.  One needs only to single out the societal \\\"ethical\\\" views of homosexuality as being the result of a voluntary choice an individual makes and of the results of being \\\"taught\\\" as to how to be a homosexual.Yet, that view comes from the same society that never questions the fact that heterosexuality is not learned but innate in \\\"good\\\" persons who are heterosexuals.Yet we know that \\\"male-ness\\\" and \\\"female-ness\\\" are genetically determined by chromosomes.\\\"Manhood\\\" and \\\"Womanhood\\\" are culturally defined terms.However, being a heterosexual man or woman is the result of those genes/chromosomes interacting with the environment.One does not need to be taught how to be heterosexual human being.If that interaction with the environment leads to altered expression of those genes during development, the male-ness/female-ness might still determine the physical genitalia, but not the brain-hormone determinants of a self-awareness of manhood or womanhood.In other words, being a homosexual is Trosko 307 not the result of being taught to be one, nor that one be taught how to reject this perception of self.This hypothesis is scientific, in that it can, and will, ultimately, be tested.Hormones, coded by genes, do make a difference during development on the genitalia.It, in all likelihood, makes a difference on other organs during development, such as the brain.In turn, this hormone-hard-wired brain will make other changes later in life.If during development, the natural expression of these critical hormone interactions is disturbed, later consequences on behavior might be noted.  The DES (diethylstilbestrol)-treated pregnant women gave rise to daughters who were at high risk to vaginal cancers later in life (Cousins et al. 1980).This is great example of the \\\"Barker hypothesis\\\" (Barker 2004), which states that in utero exposures to environmental factors can lead to altered phenotypic states later in life.  Trying to learn from the ancient Greeks' view of the best manner to govern human behavior, i.e., via democratic means, they clearly noted that a democracy will only survive with an \\\"informed electorate\\\".In today's world, with science and technology, generating so much information and \\\"stuff\\\", and consequently, options (with short-and long-term individual and population/ecological consequences) in every discipline (some have very abstract implications, such as our place in the cosmic scheme of things) to detailed methodologies for reducing suffering from various diseases, it is impossible for any one individual (very educated to totally uneducated) to be informed as to whether to use or not use that information/technology.  Re-stating the obvious that: (1) all human decisions contain two components, namely the facts related to the decision to be made and the values that will guide the factual component; and (2) the values to render that decision cannot be derived by any strict calculus from science, ultimately, even if \\\"informed\\\" electorates really knew all that is humanly possible or relevant to the decision-making process, it is the value decision (i.e., the political decision) that is the final arbiter.Science and facts alone will never be enough to be the sole factor in decision-making in a democracy.If it is important to remember at this stage, that all \\\"facts\\\" are \\\"value-laden\\\" and all values are \\\"experientially\\\"-or \\\"factually\\\"-laden.Therefore, again, at best, all scientific facts are incomplete; at worse, they can be dead wrong.However, the values to ultimately affect the use or non-use of the knowledge, in not only a democracy, but in a pluralistic world, will determine the future success and quality of survival of both the current and future generations.To make this clear, two individuals (or two democracies) have exactly the same factual knowledge of the issue at hand, could vote to use or not use the facts, based on their different values.  While C. P. Snow clearly pointed out that he could have generated categories of people into at least \\\"two thousand gaps\\\" (Snow 1964), it seems in reality, the only one that really counts in the context of this commentary is the gap between those: (1) that accept all aspects of human nature as being \\\"knowable\\\" in naturalist terms by the sciences that can study and ultimately come to some universally-accept claims on the nature of human nature; and (2) that accept only some supernatural claims of human nature, human purpose, and human destiny (Forrester 2000).This then also raises extremely complex definitions related to the ethical/moral values that spring from these \\\"scientific\\\" views of human nature and \\\"supernatural\\\" views of human nature.Those that always seem to cloud all debates are the terms, religion, and spirituality.Religion, all too often, relates to institutional doctrines concerning: (1) having a supernatural beginning of a human's life; views of life's purpose and of the here-after; and (2) set of proscriptive theological rationale and practical moral codes for earthly behavior.Within this view, if you do not adhere to the former, then clearly, you have no \\\"moral grounding or moral compass\\\" to shape your earthly behavior in any justifiable moral basis.Therefore, can an atheist, agnostic, or even a supernatural believer of another \\\"faith\\\" system lead a moral life?The answer is, of course, a person without the need to rely on ways of \\\"knowing\\\" a supernatural well-spring of religiosity, can lead a moral life, based on understanding the scientific view of human nature and human's intimate and delicate connection to all the forces of the natural physical, chemical, biological, psychological, ecological, social, and cultural worlds.  Therein lays the problem.Once an individual, convinced by one compelling scientific fact that challenges a \\\"faith\\\"-accepted view of human nature, yet does not really understand how that can prepare him/her to guide their moral life in a complex world of inevitable physical, social, cultural change, is left with this \\\"psychic black hole\\\".One of many examples, that could be used today, is the debate on the proposed use of \\\"in vitro fertilization\\\" to conceive human babies.Among the \\\"moral arguments that were used, by those relying on a 'supernatural' source for moral guidance to use or not use this technology, was that these individuals would be 'soul-less' or not really a human being\\\".Medical doctors and scientists, using this technique, could provide the technical knowledge to start the biological processes of conception and development, but by \\\"playing God\\\", they neither had the ability or the moral authority to implant a \\\"soul\\\" into these babies.Today, there are estimated to be over 30,000 such in vitro fertilized human individuals on earth.Are they less \\\"human\\\" than those conceived the \\\"old-fashion\\\" way?Could one really distinguish the naturally-conceived from the artificially-conceived individuals, in any manner possible, via some scientific diagnostic test or patterns of moral behavior, such as \\\"Are these individuals more likely to commit crimes than those conceived the natural manners, or by their acceptance or non-reliance on a supernatural way of knowing?\\\".  Given the unlikelihood of having the vast majority of human beings, who have an entrenched view of one supernatural wellspring for their moral values, it seems the future of integrating scientific facts of human nature into a \\\"bioethical world view\\\" to generate a more humane set of values looks dim.By rejecting a scientific view of their human nature and by not understanding the complex scientific concepts and facts about the origin of the universe, such as: (1) all its physical forces, and the mathematics it would take to give them some foundation for accepting that scientific knowledge; (2) the inter-connectedness of the human being with the physical, chemical, and biological/ecological world; and (3) to understand one of the important concepts to help explain the origin of complex human functions, such as how the conscious mind can emerge from the brain tissue, it is not going to be possible to convince those billions of human beings by education alone.Only when the supernatural icons can be \\\"transformed\\\" to symbolize those views of human nature to be consistent with those of modern sciences, will there be less conflict between these \\\"two cultures\\\" and a chance these \\\"scientifically-transformed supernatural icons\\\" might forge survival values to guide powerful scientific ideas and technologies.  In effect, as with a democracy, which guarantees one's freedom of religion (meaning some faith in a supernatural source of our nature and moral behavior) as a private citizen in our society, so too does it guarantees the freedom from religion, meaning, in the public domain of a pluralistic society/world, no one \\\"supernatural\\\" source of faith can be the sole guide for all.Reason, verifiable scientific facts, ability to make, at least, short-range predictions, based on scientific knowledge and ability for self-correction, should be the primary basis for governing the choices to use or not use new knowledge and technologies.Therefore, if it has to be asked, how could two rational human beings, having the ability to accept the scientific facts, identically, end up with different values.The two cultures gap, of course, could refer to differences in knowing or of accepting scientific facts.Differences in accepting scientific facts, can, in principle, be resolved, ultimately.However, the major gap has to be between those who have different values.Therefore, it is important as from whence do these \\\"values\\\" spring?Is there an absolute set of values that can be \\\"taught\\\" or mandated in some fashion to all?The answer seems to be that our individual or collectivized values stem from our unique experiences, which in this author's opinion, help to shape our view of human nature.If that view rejects or denies what all our natural and social sciences tell us about our biological, psychological, social, and cultural attributes, those values will only use science and technology in ways that will ultimately diminish the chances of human survival and higher quality of life.To say this in another way, our unique historic experiences, locked in our primitive brain, trigger unconscious choices, which are then \\\"rationalized\\\" by our modern brain.That \\\"rationalization\\\" can either be shaped by a non-scientific or scientific view of human nature.In other words, do we really have a \\\"free will\\\" or do we have a \\\"self-generated will\\\".   GLOBAL BIOETHICS AS IT RELATES TO \\\"ONE HEALTH, ONE PLANET\\\"  To bring these rather abstract ideas in focus, let us examine a real human crisis that is in the making.It is a given that all living organisms (microbes, plants, elephants, and human beings) depend on exactly the same fundamental requirements, namely, nutrients, potable water, non-polluted air, limited temperature ranges, low radiation exposure, sufficient calories from food and, in the case of humans, social and cultural environments to maintain dignity and adaptable mental health.The unique range of each of these requirements is different for each species and for the individual within each species.All living organisms need to produce energy from the foods they dependent upon.The foods they depend upon were determined by a long biological evolutionary process to select for genes that allowed for their individual and species survival to reproduce.During the biological evolution of each life form, the foods had to be available within their normal migratory range (fish, birds, tigers, or pre-human primates) or their specific stationary position in a desert, the ocean or jungle (tree, coral reef, and plant) (Milton 2000;Kiple 2000;Teaford and Ungar 2000;Mariani-Costantini 2000;Miller et al. 2000;Paoloni-Giacobino 2003;Calle and Kaaks 2004;Trosko 2007).  For most living organisms, food was obtained during either daylight or nighttime.Food was seasonally obtained.Biological/genetic systems had to adapt to food in a feast/famine fashion.All living organs, prior to human cultural evolution, had to adapt or they perished when the physical environment and food sources changed, which was and is inevitable.Today, with the appearance of human beings and their ability to create cultures, a collision of the slow biological evolution of genes needed for life-sustaining factors to deal with food for energy with the laser-speed cultural evolutionary changes that impact the whole macro-system of food-related elements for survival, we are witnessing the consequences of our biological basis for survival and normal health (Trosko 2007).  With the Diaspora of humans from Africa to Siberia to Australia and to the Americas, we witness the food requirements and biological/cultural adaptations that have occurred, which influenced genetic requirements of Asians, Africans, Caucasians, aboriginals of many continents and islands, etc., as well as their phenotypes, their food acquisition practices, dietary habits, and cuisines.Many of these food-related behaviors were embodied and codified in cultural/religious prescriptions.With the transition from hunter gatherer, the domestication of animals, multiple agricultural practices and increased availability of regular and sufficient calories, human development survived long enough and for sufficient numbers to survive acute diseases (possibly due to random genetic factors and to some positive effect of science and medicine, public health policies).  As a result, the median life span, within the last 100 years or so, has reached to almost 85 years in some societies.However, as a consequence of the positive effect of adequate food supply, better sanitation and medical knowledge and public policies, more people are living than are dying.As a result of more people living and living longer in a pluralistic cultural world, each society is impacting the physical and ecosystem environments, which in turn, are affecting the very absolute requirements for life, the global living eco-system [sea life, plant life, microorganisms, including the biologically and culturally adaptation of the gut microbiome (Kau et al. 2011), the fresh water, clean air, earth's temperature patterns, human work systems and dietary patterns, food production, distribution and processing, That fundamental and precarious dependence of food for life and good health is being negatively impacted.As a result of the exponential Diaspora of both food and people, as well as other plant and animal species, a real adaptive challenge to the health of the total life ecosystem is evident.  Prior to, and even thousands of years after, the emergence of human culture, unique patters of both acute and some chronic diseases were associated with different cultures.As a result of these recent global changes, we are witnessing major changes in both acute infectious diseases [i.e., HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)/AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome)] and more importantly, chronic diseases in humans (\\\"metabolic diseases\\\"-diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular, etc.), as we, biologically, were never designed to live as long as we now are living.Much of this food-related effects on human health, both positive and negative, has to be attributed to \\\"epigenetic\\\", not \\\"mutagenic\\\" mechanisms (Trosko 2006;Trosko, Chang, and Upham 2002;Trosko et al. 1998).  The old view of one of the human health tragedies was of caloric and nutritional deficiencies to the majority of the world.Today, while that still remains a global problem, global excess of caloric abundance, associated with nutrient-deficient diets, as well as poverty, the global Diaspora of people away from their genetically-adaptive original physical and cultural environments for a growing proportion of the world's population (diabetes in India; different cancer patterns of Japanese in Japan versus those in Seattle; obesity in China; cardiovascular problems in Sicily, etc.) is generating new health problems.In turn, based on a number of political and social factors, food security is becoming a major issue for social unrest when food is not available for the masses (The North Korean's chubby dictator versus the stunted North Korea population).Currently, there are over seven billion people on Earth.In less than a century, there will be 10 billion persons.That means three billion children will be born during this time.With the known influence that nutrition and diet makes on the health of children, especially during in utero development and neonatal exposures, medical education and global health practices could make a major preventive health care dent in lowering the risks to all kinds of diseases.The current tragedy of seeing increases in childhood chronic diseases, i.e., autism, suggest what David Barker observed decades ago (Barker 2004) that individuals who were at greatest risk to serious chronic diseases had mothers who, for whatever reasons, where exposed to bad nutrition or physical/social environments.This could be one focus for global intervention, i.e., to provide adequate nutritional diets for pregnant women of the world, to lower the risk to preventable chronic diseases in these children.This dynamic and extremely complex interaction of human cultural activities on the genes (mutations) and their expression (\\\"epigenetics\\\") is the basis of the \\\"collision\\\" of our slow biological evolution and our rapid and quixotic cultural evolution that is affecting the human disease patterns we are witnessing today, as well as the overall eco-system alteration.Emerging out of this awareness is the new paradigm of \\\"Evolutionary Molecular Medicine\\\" (Nesse et al. 2012).  Finally, what must be done to prevent more needless suffering, due to physical and mental diseases, as well to treat those already afflicted by these diseases when, currently, there is limited resources and, in the future, there will probably be less?Already the injustice done to most on our one planet has not been resolved by the \\\"Mother Theresa\\\" approach of \\\"compassionate\\\" intervention by a few, whose \\\"curiosity\\\" has been limited.On the other hand, those with the richness of knowledge, generated by their \\\"curiosity\\\", also, have failed to use that curiosity-enriched knowledge with wisdon-generated compassion.The \\\"one health-one planet\\\" concept is based on our scientific knowledge.All life is based on the genetic \\\"blueprint\\\", forged in our nucleic acids [DNA/RNA (ribonucleic acid)] by trial and error in a changing earth.A bacterium, a bird, fish, monkey, a rock star, a famous poet, a religious leader, witch doctor, farmer, mother, Nobel prize scientist, and an ordinary folk have unique genetic information, on which their unique, historic environmental factors have interacted.Not one of these unique, individual life forms can escape changes in their genetic information of their reproductive means to their species or to their own individual ability to maintain health.In other words, all life forms cannot resist inevitable changes in our physical, chemical, social, and cultural environments that could either alter our genes or their expression.Change is inevitable in both our genes and our environments.While anaerobic bacteria, by the change caused by the emergence of phytoplankton that changed over eons of the oxygenation of the planet, we humans, created culture, that now is changing the earth's ecosystem in a short while, which is now challenging the survival of most life.It is interesting to note that early aerobic bacteria, found in the deepest sediment in the oceans, have survived the bulk of evolutionary changes that created human culture that is changing the global ecosystem and might even survive any global catastrophy that might eliminate the post-bacterial transition to human culture (Ray et al. 2012).  Therefore, the global task must be to head off the inevitable \\\"train wreck\\\" before us, where, with current scientific knowledge of: (1) our dependency of a sustained ecology to provide adequate calories and nutrients for all to prevent many diseases, is not being implemented; (2) of the consequences of uncontrolled population growth; (3) of the continued lack of educational opportunities for the masses of human beings; and (4) of the persistent lack of justice and humane dignity for too many of the world's population.To rely on \\\"faith\\\", prayer, intuition, and other non-rational or non-scientific means of reasoning to deal with the current and obvious state of global crises is a recipe for disaster.While, scientific reasoning is not foolproof in predicting future events, its predictions can either be tested or self-corrected.   CONCLUSIONS  Based on the assumption that human actions, shaped by our values, are the direct (conscious or unconscious) consequence of our views of human nature, it seems obvious that most, if not all, of these current theological and political views of human nature have not incorporated scientific knowledge of human biology and evolution of the human cultural animal.These non-scientific views of human nature, in the multiple global religious and political systems, have guided the use/misuse of powerful technologies.As a result, in large part, these unscientific views of human nature are responsible for the deterioration of the global ecosystem on which all life depends and for the global metabolic diseases in human health.In a pluralistic cultural world, with no unified moral philosophy to guide the explosion of new powerful globally-affecting knowledge and technologies, the chances to prevent predicted massive human tragedies are slim unless a new view of human nature is universally shared in these different cultural theological/political systems.From a \\\"One Health\\\" perspective, in which the global ecology, animal and human health are inexorably linked, the fundamental concept of how biological and cultural evolution must be incorporated in all of these very different parochial moral views that shape political and economic policies.This analysis provided a number of views of human nature, consistent with current scientific evidence from many scientific disciplines, which now has to be integrated into all cultural institutions, in order that a systems and integrated use of new powerful technologies be examined before their unwise use.

The overarching goal for TROP-ICS is to provide nearly all-weather observations of 3D temperature and humidity, as well as cloud ice and precipitation horizontal structure, at high temporal resolution to conduct high-value science investigations of tropical cyclones. TROPICS will provide rapid-refresh microwave measurements (median refresh rate better than 60 min for the baseline mission) which can be used to observe the thermodynamics of the troposphere and precipitation structure for storm systems at the mesoscale and synoptic scale over the entire storm life cycle. TROPICS comprises six Cube-Sats in three low-Earth orbital planes. Each CubeSat will host a high-performance radiometer to provide temperature profiles using seven channels near the 118.75 GHz oxygen absorption line, water vapour profiles using three channels near the 183 GHz water vapour absorption line, imagery in a single channel near 90 GHz for precipitation measurements (when combined with higher-resolution water vapour channels), and a single channel near 205 GHz which is more sensitive to precipitation-sized ice particles. This observing system offers an unprecedented combination of horizontal and temporal resolution to measure environmental and inner-core conditions for tropical cyclones on a nearly global scale and is a major leap forward in the temporal resolution of several key parameters needed for assimilation into advanced data assimilation systems capable of utilizing rapid-update radiance or retrieval data. Launch readiness is currently projected for late 2019.  (National Research Council, 2007)  recommended the Precipitation and All-weather Temperature and Humidity (PATH) mission as a means of obtaining three-dimensional (3D) temperature and humidity measurements as well as precipitation. PATH was envisioned primarily as a microwave instrument suite in geosynchronous orbit that would provide 15-30 min temporal refresh, but would by necessity be limited in sensor spatial resolution and overall coverage. Low-Earth orbit (LEO) sensors were viewed as impractical due to the large number of constellation members that would be needed to provide 15-30 min sampling. However, since that survey, new technologies have evolved which now make possible the formation of constellations of smallsat radiometers capable of delivering measurements that are directly relevant to PATH objectives with refresh rates of 30-60 min and near-global coverage at a small fraction of the cost of a geostationary sounder.  The Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats (TROPICS) CubeSat mission will provide rapid-refresh microwave measurements over the Tropics to observe the thermodynamics and precipitation structure of TCs over much of their life cycle. TROPICS comprises six CubeSats (dual-spinning, 6.0 kg, 3 units or 3U) spread across three 550 km altitude, 30 \\u2022 inclination orbital planes for up to one year. Each CubeSat contains a 2U spacecraft bus and hosts a 1U high-performance 12-channel microwave radiometer scanning across the satellite track at 30 revolutions per minute (RPM) to provide both sounding (temperature and humidity, 2-3 km vertical resolution) and imaging capabilities. The sensor will include seven channels near the 118.75 GHz oxygen absorption line for temperature, three channels near the 183 GHz water vapour absorption line for moisture, a single channel at 90 GHz (combined with temperature and moisture channels) for precipitation structure detection, and a single channel near 205 GHz for larger cloud/smaller precipitation ice measurements. The full swath of the radiometer observations will be fully programmable and extendable to \\u00b160 \\u2022 from nadir, with a 1.5 \\u2022 cross-track sampling interval (81 spots/swath) and fields-of-view (FOVs) comparable to the scale of warm thermal anomalies associated with TC cores. Data latency (space-to-ground) will likely be at least several days, therefore TROPICS will be focused on data collection and science, rather than on operationally driven real-time mission objectives.   THE TROPICS OBSERVATORY  TROPICS comprises a constellation of six identical space vehicles (SVs) conforming to the 3U CubeSat form factor and hosting a passive microwave spectrometer payload. The constellation members will be flown in a circular LEO in nearly equally spaced orbital planes, with multiple satellites populating each orbital plane. Each orbit inclination will be roughly 30 \\u2022 . The constellation will allow for rapid-revisit sampling of vertical temperature and moisture profiles of TCs. Figure 1 shows the median revist, the mean revisit, and the fraction of time measurements are observed with revisit rates greater than 2 hr as a function of the constellation orbital configuration. Three orbital planes are considered, with some number of satellites populating each orbital plane (up to four in each plane). The satellites are ejected upon deployment with unique velocities to virtually eliminate the possibility of multi-plane satellite conjunctions (satellites overlapping simultaneously in multiple orbital planes), even when the satellites are allowed to drift freely with no active control (\\\"random phasing\\\"). The revisit rate of the constellation is a function of latitude, and the historical frequency of named TCs is also a function of latitude. To create a scalar revisit metric, the constellation revisit rate as a function of latitude is weighted by the historical storm frequency as a function of latitude. The TROPICS baseline mission will fly six satellites (two in each of three planes), which will allow the baseline mission requirement of 1 hr median revisit to be achieved even with the failure of up to two satellites. Also shown in Figure 1 is a cumulative distribution function of the revisit rates. An important consideration of the TROPICS constellation architecture is the presence of long gaps and the impact this could have on the value of the observations. To assess this, TROPICS swaths were simulated using an 11-day Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model Hurricane Nature Run (HNR) (Nolan et al., 2013). The baseline TROPICS orbital configuration, denoted 2-2-2, uses two satellites in each of three equally spaced orbital planes with 30-degree inclination and 550 km altitude. As shown in Figure 2 for the baseline 2-2-2 configuration, there can be up to several relatively large gaps per day. However, many features in the storm are preserved, even in the presence of occasional gaps. Also shown for reference in Figure 2c is the temporal sampling of an alternate constellation with three satellites in each of two equally spaced planes. Long gap times are more frequent in this configuration, but useful temporal coverage is still obtained.  The passive microwave (PMW) spectrometer antenna is mounted on a rotating axis which will spin about the long axis of the SV. The long axis is aligned to the satellite velocity vector such that the spectrometer will record measurements along a line perpendicular to the satellite velocity in a \\\"cross-track-scan\\\" fashion which maximizes the area scan rate of the instrument. Each SV will record the raw passive microwave data and relay the raw data to the ground, where the data will be processed to produce the temperature and moisture profiles. Spatial resolution (averaged over the swath) is approximately 25 km for the moisture channels (183-206 GHz) and approximately 40 km for the temperature channels (90-118 GHz). Radiometric data are calibrated using an onboard noise diode referencewhich is turned on and off against the cold-sky background at least once per revolution (every 2 s). The earth-projected scan pattern is shown in Figure 3, and additional details on spatial resolution are provided in section 2.2.  The TROPICS observatory will provide a set of products as shown in Table 1, including raw (uncalibrated) radiances, calibrated and geolocated radiances, temperature and moisture profiles, rain rate, and intensity indicators. Details on these products and their use in the TROPICS science program is described below.   Space vehicles  Each SV in the six-member TROPICS constellation is an identical 3U CubeSat consisting of a MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL) spectrometer payload integrated onto a commercially procured bus. The spectrometer payload consists of a rotating passive radio frequency (RF) antenna measuring spectral radiance as it rotates about the SV velocity vector. The payload is based upon a similar payload previously designed by MIT LL for the MicroMAS-2 mission (Micro-sized Microwave Atmospheric Satellite; Blackwell, 2017). The engineering team will modify the design in order to meet TROPICS performance and mission reliability requirements. The redesign includes:  \\u2022 Antenna modification to optimize ground profile while minimizing side lobes \\u2022 Noise reduction in analogue front end \\u2022 Higher-dynamic-range analogue-to-digital converter \\u2022 Modifications to spectrometer channel centre frequencies and bandwidths \\u2022 Higher-reliability control electronics \\u2022 Higher-reliability and lower-power motor-scanner assembly  The redesign effort does not include any high-risk modifications, and should simplify the build and calibration of the payload relative to the MicroMAS-2 baseline design.  A notional SV including the bus and payload is shown in Figure 4. The MicroMAS-2 bus does not have sufficient pointing accuracy or power generation capability to meet TROPICS mission requirements. The TROPICS bus will match much of the functionality of the MicroMAS-2 bus, but will take advantage of recent commercial advances in Cube-Sat reliability and bus technology. In particular, making use of available GPS receivers for position knowledge and star  Table 2 Level 1b Timestamped, geolocated, calibrated brightness temperature with bias removed See Table 2 Level 2a Spatially resampled G-band brightness temperature to F-band resolution N/A   Level 2b  Atmospheric vertical temperature profile (K) 2 K r.m.s. at 50 km scan-averaged spatial resolution Level 2b Atmospheric vertical moisture profile (g g \\u22121 ) 25% at 25 km scan-averaged spatial resolution cameras for attitude knowledge will greatly enhance the data product geolocation accuracy.  The spacecraft bus will be procured from Blue Canyon Technologies and will provide power and power conditioning, communications, on-board processing, thermal management, and Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) to the satellite. The flight software will provide command and control of the payload, and will interface with the bus communications system to manage payload commands and prepare payload telemetry for downlink.   2.2  Radiometer characteristics TROPICS will continue a long history of microwave sounding/imaging missions targeted to the study of storms. For example, the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (Hou et al., 2014) and the Megha-Tropiques Mission (Desbois et al., 2003) both observe storms and severe weather with very high measurement fidelity but very low temporal resolution. TROPICS will fly two total power radiometers that measure 12 channels spanning approximately 90-206 GHz. The \\\"WF-band\\\" radiometer comprises eight channels from 90 to 119 GHz, and the \\\"G-band\\\" radiometer comprises four channels from 183 to 206 GHz. The specific channel properties are shown in Table 2. The full-widths at half maximum antenna beamwidths are achieved using an offset parabolic reflector illuminated with two feed horns which are physically separated, and the beams are combined and colocated using a polarizing wire grid diplexer. Beam efficiencies for the temperature and water vapour sounding channels are designed to exceed 95%. Radiometer calibration is accomplished using weakly coupled noise diodes with known and stable noise output which are turned on and off against the cold space background. Satellite intercalibration is optimized using cross-comparisons (Biswas et al., 2013) and daily calculated numerical model residuals (Saunders et al., 2013) to derive and implement any needed bias corrections.  The radiometer operates in an \\\"integrate-while-scanning\\\" mode which results in elongated footprints in the cross-track direction. The spatial resolution is thus reported as the geometric mean of the minor and major axes of the ellipse projected on the Earth, also accounting for Earth curvature. As the constellation of six satellites scans the Earth, the footprints near the edge of the scan are revisited more often than the footprints near nadir. This effect is quantified by calculating an \\\"effective\\\" spatial resolution which weights the spatial resolution of each footprint by the relative frequency with which it is revisited. The nadir, mean-across-scan, and effective spatial resolutions are shown in Table 3. The satellite pointing accuracy and sensor mounting requirements are set to ensure geolocation errors are smaller than approximately 10% of the footprint size.  Temperature weighting functions for all 12 TROPICS channels are shown in Figure 5. Channel passbands are designed to span altitudes from the surface up to 20 km for temperature and 10 km for water vapour. Multiple temperature channels probe the upper troposphere to observe TC warm core anomalies.   Ground station and data processing  The TROPICS SVs will interface with a ground station network to allow for SV command and control and downlink of bus and payload telemetry for each member of the constellation. Stored mission data will be downlinked at S-band. The data products will be made available to the data processing centre via a secured connection. University of Wisconsin (UW) Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC) as the data processing lead will archive the data to an Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) in a format approved by NASA Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS).   SCIENCE OBJECTIVES  The overarching goal for the TROPICS mission is to provide nearly all-weather observations of 3D temperature and Weighting functions calculated at nadir incidence over a perfectly emissive surface for a standard tropical atmosphere for both (a) temperature/imaging and (b) water vapour/imaging channels humidity, as well as cloud ice and precipitation horizontal structure, at high temporal resolution compared to current passive microwave (PMW) measurements, to conduct high-value science investigations of TCs including:  1. Relationships between rapidly evolving precipitation structure, upper-level warm-core evolution, and associated storm intensity changes; 2. The evolution of TC precipitation structure and storm intensification in relation to environmental humidity fields; and 3. The impact of TROPICS rapid-update microwave observations on numerical and statistical intensity forecasts of TCs.  While the mission chose to focus on TC applications, the proposed constellation can certainly address a much wider range of science goals including analysis of tropical mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), and monsoon weather.  The major limitations in predicting intensity change in TCs are an inadequate understanding of the processes that cause it, insufficient sampling of appropriate observations of the storm environment and internal processes, and inadequate representation of those processes in models (Rogers et al., 2006). The challenge for TC intensity prediction is that storm strength depends on processes operating at spatial scales ranging from the cloud scale to synoptic scale and time-scales from 30 min to diurnal. The smaller-scale phenomena are more difficult to observe, tend to be more chaotic, and their interaction with larger scales is poorly understood.  Addressing these TC intensity science goals requires rapid-update quantitative observations of storm structure and environment, but current observing systems are inadequate for this purpose. Geosynchronous visible and infrared systems provide nearly continuous observations, but storm structure information is primarily limited to the evolution of cloud tops. Passive microwave observations from LEOs, in contrast, reveal the TC structure beneath the cloud tops, but are relatively infrequent with gaps in time of several hours. Proposed geostationary PMW systems remain an unproven technology and would only provide data over a portion of a single ocean basin. TROPICS is designed to bridge these gaps by providing high-resolution, rapid-update PMW measurements over all TC ocean basins which will increase our observations and knowledge of the processes that lead to significant, and sometimes rapid, changes in TC structure and intensity. TROPICS provides a relatively low-cost, high-impact means of addressing the following science questions.   3.1  What are the relationships between upper-level warm-core evolution and storm intensity and structure change?  The formation of an upper-level warm core is a key indicator of TC development and the processes that lead to warm core formation are thus key to understanding how it is linked with the onset and continuation of intensification. The TC warm core has been the subject of numerous studies spanning decades of research (e.g. Velden, 1989;Velden et al., 1991;Brueske and Velden, 2003;Demuth et al., 2006;Halverson et al., 2006;Bessho et al., 2010;Stern and Nolan, 2012;Kieu et al., 2016). However, mainly due to observing limitations, our understanding of how it evolves and relates to TC structure change is still incomplete. In order to improve TC intensity analyses and forecasts, the factors controlling warm-core evolution need to be better observed and understood.  PMW sounders operating in the 53-55 GHz and 115-118 GHz frequency bands are sufficiently transparent to cloud cover to allow a coarse mapping of the TC warm core in the \\u223c 100-400 hPa layer ( Figure 6) and coincident horizontal precipitation structure (Figure 7, from the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) and having horizontal resolution comparable to that of the TROPICS mission). A robust relationship exists between these thermal anomalies and TC intensity as measured by reconnaissance The primary limitation of current PMW sounders for monitoring TCs is that they reside on polar-orbiting satellites.  Views over weather systems in the Tropics are not continuous, and there can be gaps in coverage over a particular TC of up to 8-12 hr, even with the current constellation. Since rapid intensity changes can take place on the order of a few hours, this coverage is sub-optimal for monitoring the evolution of TC characteristics (i.e. warm-core anomaly, precipitation structure). TROPICS will bridge this temporal gap by providing more rapid refresh of these critical observations.   3.2  What is the role of rapidly evolving storm structure in TC formation and intensity change?  Many TC observational and modelling studies have examined the role of precipitation in rapid intensification (RI) with an emphasis on the role of convective bursts (CBs), i.e. focused locations of deep, vigorous convection characterized by cold and expanding cloud tops, ice scattering in PMW imagery, lightning, and towers of high reflectivity (Cecil et al., 2002) which are indicative of strong updraughts. Kelley et al. (2005) identified CBs from the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) and found that storms exhibiting deep (> 14.5 km altitude) convective towers in the eyewall intensified 71% of the time while storms with echo tops < 10 km weakened 87% of the time. The role that CBs play in intensification has been attributed to localized vortex stretching and aggregation in the boundary layer (Hendricks et al., 2004;Montgomery et al., 2006;Braun et al., 2010), warming from upper-level subsidence around the periphery of the bursts (e.g. Heymsfield et al., 2001;Zhang and Chen, 2012) and diabatic heating in a region of elevated inertial stability inside the radius of maximum wind (RMW; e.g. Vigh and Schubert, 2009;Rogers et al., 2013).  In contrast to emphasizing the role of CBs, other studies have used PMW sensors to emphasize the importance of the azimuthal coverage of rainfall on RI. Using 85.5 GHz imagery, Harnos and Nesbitt (2011) showed that a symmetric ring of convection appeared in a climatological composite of RI events. A PMW-aided study by Jiang and Ramirez (2013) showed that RI is accompanied by greater spatial coverage of rain in the inner core. A TRMM PR study by Zagrodnik and Jiang (2014) showed that precipitation frequency and the coverage of rainfall increase in the inner core and become more symmetric over time in rapidly intensifying TCs.  In order to determine whether or not CBs play a critical role in RI, rapid-refresh microwave observations which allow for tracking the evolution of CBs (movement around the eye, azimuthal asymmetries about the centre, intermittency or tendency to form in clusters) will be necessary, as illustrated in Figure 8.  In the figure, Hovm\\u00f6ller diagrams illustrate the evolution of CBs in a simulated storm in a WRF model nature run (Nolan et al., 2013) with data degraded to 30 km resolution. The abscissa represents azimuth (direction relative to the storm centre) while the ordinate is time (in days). Tracking of CBs within TCs rapidly degrades when gaps in sampling are FIGURE 8 Azimuth versus time plots of simulated 114.85 GHz brightness temperatures from a WRF nature run, averaged over a circle extending from the simulated TC centre to 120 km radius, and sampled at the indicated time intervals (a) 30 min, (b) 1, (c) 2, (d) 3, and (e) 6 hr. Lower temperatures correspond to the movement of convective bursts (CBs) around the eyewall (black arrows). There is good tracking of individual CBs for sampling intervals \\u2264 1 h; tracking rapidly degrades for sampling intervals > 2 h. The cluster of CBs between days 3 and 4 is associated with a rapid change of storm intensity during that time, as indicated by (f) the simulated minimum sea-level pressure consistently > 2 h. TROPICS will provide a viable configuration for viewing TCs with median refresh rates (\\u223c 40 min) commensurate with the time-scales of evolving convection and gaps > 2 h occurring about 55% of the time. The TROP-ICS frequencies will provide a wealth of information on scattering by precipitation-sized ice particles in CBs, including information in the expanding upper-cloud shield (in the unique 205 GHz channel sensitive to small precipitation-ice particles). The data will be used to track the macrostructure of CBs in TCs across the globe for entire TC life cycles and will provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the importance of CBs in RI.   3.3  How does environmental moisture impact TC structure, size, and intensity?  High relative humidity in the middle troposphere has long been recognized as an important factor in determining where TCs form (Gray, 1975;1979;McBride, 1998). DeMaria et al. (2001) showed that their formulation of a TC genesis parameter, of which mid-level moisture is a part, can provide useful information on the probability of storm formation. Environmental humidity also exerts a significant impact on storms after development. Hill and Lackmann (2009) and Kimball (2006) examined the impact of dry environmental air in numerical simulations and found that higher environmental humidities led to increased outer rainband production, larger storms, and broader storm-force wind distributions, but not necessarily to stronger storms. Braun et al. (2012) showed that asymmetric ingestion of dry air (e.g. caused by dry air being located preferentially on one side of the storm) can lead to significant precipitation asymmetries, but found that, in the absence of significant wind shear, dry air had difficulty penetrating the core of storms, thereby limiting impacts on intensity.  In contrast, other studies have suggested that significant relationships exist between environmental humidity and storm intensity. (Kaplan and DeMaria, 2003) showed that high values of 700-850 hPa relative humidity generally favour RI of TCs. Shu and Wu (2009) suggested that, in weakening storms, dry air penetrates to smaller storm radius than in intensifying storms, usually in the quadrants to the left of the storm motion. Wu et al. (2012) found more moist conditions within 200-400 km of the storm centre in intensifying and RI storms compared to weakening storms. A major unknown is whether the dry air acts to potentially weaken TCs through modification of precipitation structure or overall convective activity (Braun et al., 2012). TROP-ICS will provide coupled measurements of the more slowly varying environmental humidity around a TC and previously unresolvable short-term variations in vortex-scale horizontal precipitation structure over the lifetime of storms which will FIGURE 9 Maximum 10 m wind speeds (kts) from the NOAA Hurricane Research Division HWRF OSSE using the WRF nature run. (a) shows that the lack of a \\\"bogus\\\" TC vortex in the model initialization contributed to large initial intensity errors. (b) shows a marked reduction in the short-term intensity forecast errors from assimilating TROPICS data; thus better environmental analyses near TCs can improve subsequent TC forecasts enhance our ability to determine the extent of environmental humidity control on TC precipitation and intensity.   Can TC intensity forecasts be improved through utilization of rapid-update microwave information?  TROPICS data offer great potential for improving forecasts from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Data impact studies will utilize two state-of-the-art numerical models, the NOAA Hurricane WRF (HWRF) model and the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) model. Figure 9 shows a mesoscale Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) performed with HWRF to quantify the potential improvement in the intensity forecast of a TC from a WRF HNR (Nolan et al., 2013) when TROPICS temperature and moisture observations are added to a control that includes all routine operational observations. The data were spatially blurred to 30 km to approximate TROPICS resolution (23.3 km mean across scan for moisture and 34.9 km mean across scan for temperature), and included measurements at 30 min intervals throughout the HNR life cycle. Because the forecast system does not use a vortex initialization technique to correct for errors in the initial analysis, without TROPICS data the analyzed initial intensity becomes poorly represented (Figure 9a) as the storm intensifies. Simulated TROPICS data lead to significant improvements in the initial mean sea-level pressure (not shown) and maximum wind speed (Figure 9b) which are maintained through the first 27 hr of simulation. HWRF will be used to conduct pre-launch OSSEs and post-launch Observing System Experiments (OSEs) to evaluate the impacts of TROPICS data. Furthermore, simulations will be used to evaluate the relative impact of environmental moisture on TC structure and intensity, particularly in the context of dry air-shear-vortex interactions.  Once real TROPICS data become available, these data will be ingested by the GEOS-5 data assimilation system (DAS). It is expected that the GEOS-5 DAS will already have a 4D variational assimilation system implemented by then to better exploit the temporally frequent observations provided by TROPICS. Data impacts will be examined in the context of a diminished observing system, such as a future atmosphere-observing satellite gap. A variety of metrics will be considered, including general NWP scores and more specialized metrics concerning TC analysis and forecasts.  Statistical and dynamical models provide intensity forecasts of comparable accuracy. However, statistical models are still superior for anticipating rapid intensity changes . Parameters derived from infrared imagery from geostationary satellites, and PMW data from LEO satellites, are important components of statistical RI models . Rozoff et al. (2015) found that the relative skill improvements from including PMW-based predictors range from 10 to 45%. However, the low time resolution of current microwave data is a limitation of their use in RI prediction. In addition, the resolution of current microwave sounder data is fairly coarse relative to the size of the TC warm core, which introduces sensitivity to the satellite footprint location relative to the storm centre. The higher time resolution of TROPICS data makes it much more likely to obtain a satellite pass where the sounder footprint is aligned with the cyclone centre. A number of predictors from the TROPICS data will be evaluated as input to the statistical RI models, including eyewall organizational parameters and temperature and moisture parameters in the near-storm environment.  Statistical models for RI rely on classification methods such as linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression to separate RI and non-RI cases using predictors from the storm environment and inner core. Experimental versions of these models can be developed to assess the potential for improvement through new data sources, provided that a developmental data source is available for model training. Ideally, these models would be trained on TROPICS data. This would not be possible until near the end of the experiment, where one season of global TC cases might be marginally sufficient. However, new satellite data types have been successfully evaluated using statistical models trained on proxy data. For example, the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) TC intensity and structure algorithm was developed from AMSU temperature retrievals, but implemented directly with ATMS retrievals when those first became available. The algorithm worked well and the bias that was introduced was correctable with only a short overlap period between ATMS and AMSU. This method does not capture all of the information available in new data sources since the statistical relationships with the proxy data usually are weaker than they would be with more accurate input, but this method can provide a lower-bound estimate of what can be expected from the new observations. For the TROPICS experiment, we will utilize ATMS data and possibly AMSU for the training, and then run the algorithm with the TROPICS input. When an overlap period is obtained, a bias correction will be investigated, followed by training with TROPICS data near the end of the experiment.   SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS  A constellation of passive cross-track-scanning microwave radiometers in orbits that permit rapid sampling of the tropical cyclone belt at all longitudes is being developed with launch readiness expected in late 2019. Observations will be available in 12 channels from 90 to 205 GHz which will enable a host of new science questions to be addressed. All data will be publicly available through NASA.

The horizontal resolution of TROPICS data will be very similar to that of ATMS aircraft. Since 1998, the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) flown aboard the Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) series of spacecraft has been used to develop intensity estimation techniques which exploit a microwave sounder's ability to map upper-level temperatures in TCs and monitor the evolution of the warm-core anomaly. Since then, similar microwave sounders have become available (e.g. Special Sensor Microwave Imager/ Sounder -SSMIS -on Defense Meteorological Satellite Program -DMSP -satellites; ATMS on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite -NPP).

This study aimed at isolating and identifying algicidal bacteria in Dinoflagellate culture and to determine the optimum growth requirement of the algicidal bacteria, Loktanella sp. Gb-03.Materials and Methods:The Dinoflagellate culture used in this study was supplied by Professor Gires Usup's Laboratory, School of Environmental and Natural Resources Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, University Kebangsaan Malaysia, Malaysia. The culture was used for the isolation of Loktanella sp., using biochemical tests, API 20 ONE kits. The fatty acid content of the isolates and the algicidal activity were further evaluated, and the phenotype was determined through the phylogenetic tree. Results: Gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming, short rod-shaped, aerobic bacteria (Gb01, Gb02, Gb03, Gb04, Gb05, and Gb06) were isolated from the Dinoflagellate culture. The colonies were pink in color, convex with a smooth surface and entire edge. The optimum growth temperature for the Loktanella sp. Gb03 isolate was determined to be 30\\u00b0C, in 1% of NaCl and pH7. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the bacterium belonged to the genus Loktanella of the class Alphaproteobacteria and formed a tight cluster with the type strain of Loktanella pyoseonensis (97.0% sequence similarity). Conclusion: On the basis of phenotypic, phylogenetic data and genetic distinctiveness, strain Gb-03, were placed in the genus Loktanella as the type strain of species. Moreover, it has algicidal activity against seven toxic Dinoflagellate. The algicidal property of the isolated Loktanella is vital, especially where biological control is needed to mitigate algal bloom or targeted Dinoflagellates.  Introduction  The widespread of poisonous cyanobacterial blooms in rivers, lakes and reservoirs globally has become an increasing health problem. These blooms are also responsible for livestock death and concurrently posing great public health challenge, in addition, to their havoc on the aquatic ecosystems [1][2][3]. Several bacteria isolated in association with various harmful algal bloom (HAB) species, including dinoflagellates and raphidophytes, have been shown to have algicidal activity [4][5][6][7][8]. Bacteria associated with HABs can play an important role in regulating algal blooms in the environment [9][10][11]. Laboratory studies had evaluated bacteria or bacteria-derived algicidal compounds to develop a short-term solution for controlling HABs growth [12][13][14][15][16][17]. These studies showed that algicidal bacteria can exhibit a range of specificity and may use mechanisms to mediate algicidal effects on targeted Dinoflagellate species. Many studies have found algicidal bacteria which have activity on a specific genus or species of Dinoflagellate [18][19][20] while others studies showed algicidal bacteria has activity against range of algal classes [21][22][23].  On the other hand, bacteria with algicidal activities such as those from the genus Loktanella has been described [24], to originally contained three species, namely Loktanella salsilacus, Loktanella fryxellensis, and Loktanella vestfoldensis. Subsequently, six other species from this genus were described, these includes Loktanella hongkongensis [25,26], Loktanella agnita and Loktanella rosea [27], Loktanella koreensis [28], Loktanella maricola [29] and Loktanella atrilutea [30] were described.  To the best of our knowledge, there is no study investigating marine algicidal bacteria against toxic Dinoflagellates in Malaysia water. We hypothesized that bacteria isolates from Malaysian water possess strong and powerful algicidal activity against wide range of Dinoflagellates species. Attempts to isolate algicidal bacteria from Malaysian water could reveal the potentials of Malaysian marine as a good source of natural algicides, and they may be of great importance in term of HAB control.  Hence, this study aimed at isolating marine algicidal bacteria from Dinoflagellates culture and to optimize their growth requirement. Here we report the taxonomic characterization of a Loktanella-like bacterial, Gb-03, which was isolated from Dinoflagellate culture.   Materials and Methods   Ethical approval  There is no need of ethical approval for such type of study.   Source of Dinoflagellate culture  The Dinoflagellate culture used in the study contain Dinoflagellate species such as Coolia malaynesis, Alxandrium sp., Alxandrium leei, Alxandrium affine, Alxandrium tamiyavanichi, Alxandrium tamarense, Gambierdiscus belizeanus, and Ostreopsis. The culture was kindly supplied by Professor Gires Usup, School of Environmental and Natural Resources Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, University Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600 (UKM) Bangi, Malaysia. The culture was continuously cultivated in ES-DK medium [31].   Isolation  Dinoflagellate culture from samples in UKM marine laborator were used for the isolation, and the algicidal activity of the most consistent isolate of the six isolates was further investigated. For isolation, standard dilution plating technique at 25\\u00b0C on marine agar 2216 (MA;Difco) was used. The resultant suspension was serially diluted in 10-fold steps by the addition of 1 ml of the previous dilution to 9 ml saline, 0.1 ml aliquots from each diluted suspension were spread on MA 2216 (Difco) plates. The plates were then incubated under aerobic conditions at 25\\u00b0C for 5 days. The morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics of isolates were investigated using routine cultivation on MA at 30\\u00b0C for 36-48 h. Isolates were maintained on MA at 4\\u00b0C for short-term preservation and as a glycerol suspension (20%, w/v in distilled water) at \\u221280\\u00b0C for long-term preservation.   Characterization  Growth at various NaCl concentrations was investigated using nutrient broth (NB) 2216 (NB; Difco). Growth at various temperatures (4-45\\u00b0C) was measured on MB. Growth on NB (Difco), trypticase soy broth (TSB; Difco), MacConkey broth (Difco) and URE broth base were tested.  Colony morphology and pigmentation were determined using a culture grown at 30\\u00b0C for 36-48 h. Cell morphology was observed under light microscopy (E600; Nikon). Motility was assessed on a semi-solid agar tube containing marine broth (Difco) supplemented with 0.4% agar. Cells were inoculated by stabbing with a straight needle and the tube was incubated at 25\\u00b0C for 5 days. Gram-staining was performed using a Gram-stain methods. Growth under anaerobic conditions was determined after incubation in a forma anaerobic chamber on MA plate for 48 h at 30\\u00b0C. Growth in the absence of NaCl was investigated using NB (Difco). Oxidase and catalase activities were determined according to Ledeboer and Doern [32]. Other physiological and biochemical properties were tested using API 20NE (bioM\\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). For these tests, cells were suspended in a solution of 0.85% of NaCl. Results were recorded after 48 h incubation at 30\\u00b0C.   Genetic identification   DNA extraction  Sterivex filters were thawed, and DNA was extracted following a modification of the method of Weon et al. and Maarit Niemi et al. [29,33]. Filters were filled with 1.8 ml sodium chloride-tris-ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) buffer (10 mM tris-hydrochloride [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaCl) containing fresh lysozyme (5 mg/mL) and sealed with a syringe and cap for a 1 h incubation at 37\\u00b0C. A 3 \\u03bcl aliquot of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) and 100 \\u03bcl of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution were added to the filter and incubated for 2 h at 60\\u00b0C. Then 100 \\u03bcl of NaCl (5M) was added to the tube, and 80 \\u03bcl of cethyletrimethylammonium bromide was added and incubated for 10 min at 65\\u00b0C. After that 600 \\u03bcl of chloroform: isoamyle alcohol (24:1) was added to the tube and centrifuged at 1500 \\u00d7g for 5 min at 4\\u00b0C. The clear part was transferred to a clean tube and equal volume of phenol: chloroform:isoamyle alcohol (25:24:1) was added to the tube.  The sample was centrifuged at 10,000 \\u00d7g for 5 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube. The DNA was precipitated by the addition of 300 \\u03bcl 70% ethanol. By centrifugation at 14,500 \\u00d7g for 30 min, and the precipitated DNA was collected. After discarding the supernatant, the DNA was re-suspended in 400 \\u03bcl tris-EDTA buffer and incubated at 37\\u00b0C for 1 h.   Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  The 16S rRNA was amplified using universal bacterial primers 27F and 1492R, according to Neefs et al., 1990. PCR amplification was performed with 30 thermal cycles programmed as follows; denaturation for 1 min at 94\\u00b0C, annealing for 2 min, 30 s at 55\\u00b0C, an extension for 2 min, 30 s at 72\\u00b0C, and with a final elongation step of 5 min at 72\\u00b0C. The molecular size of PCR amplicon was determined by agarose electrophoresis. The PCR products (amplicon) were purified using Q1Aprep Spin Miniprep Kits prior to sequencing [34].  The 16S rRNA sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL W software Ver. 1.7 [35]. Kimura's two-parameter model [36] was applied for the calculations of evolutionary distance. A phylogenetic tree Available at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.9/February-2016/6.pdf was constructed using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA 6 software [37]. Gb 03 sequences were deposited in NCBI GenBank with the accession numbers; Loktanella sp. strain UKMGb03A (KU199217), Loktanella sp. strain UKMGb03B (KU199218) and Loktanella sp. strain UKMGb03C (KU199219).  Fatty acid extraction was carried out by method described by Desbois and Smith [38]. The cellular fatty acid profiles of strain Gb-03 consisted of straight-chain saturated and unsaturated components with small amounts of hydroxyl.  Fatty acids; these profiles were almost similar to those of other members of the genus Loktanella [24,26,27,29,30]. The fatty acid profiles of strain Gb-03 is shown in Table-1.   Algicidal activity  In this experiment, Alxandrium sp., A. leei, A. affine, A. tamiyavanichi, A. tamarense, G. belizeanus, and Ostreopsis were used to investigate the algicidal activity of the isolates. We used test flask, 10 ml of the Dinoflagellates culture at the mid-exponential growth phase (1.0 \\u00d7 10 3 135 cell/mL) was added in the test flask, and 1 ml of the isolate culture was added to the test flask as well, to test the algicidal activity of Gb03 culture on Dinoflagellate. After 24 h incubation time the cells were observed using counting chamber (Sedgwick-Rafter cells [grid]).   Results and Discussion   Description of Loktanella sp. Gb-03  The cells were Gram-negative, aerobic and rodshaped (0.6-0.86, 1.3-3.0 mm), non-motile. Colonies were circular, smooth, convex with an entire margin and pinkish in color. The isolates were observed to grow between 10 and 45\\u00b0C and the optimum growth temperature was observed to be 30\\u00b0C. The isolates were also found to grow in a range of pH between pH 6.0-12.0 and the optimum pH was found to be pH 7.0-8.0. The isolate grows on nutrient agar supplemented with 0.5-1.0% (w/v) NaCl, with optimum growth at 1%. While the isolates were able to grow in the presence of nutrient agar supplemented with NaCl, the bacteria were observed to be unable to grow in nutrient agar with no NaCl supplementation. The isolate was positive for catalase and oxidase activities, nitrate reduction, and gelatin liquefaction. But it was negative for glucose fermentation, arginine dihydrolase and indole production (API 20NE) ( Table-2). The isolate does not grow in MacConkey broth and URE broth, but it grows in TSB (Difco) [24,27,29,30].  Following the amplification of the bacteria DNA with PCR, using 16S rRNA gene, the 1300 bp amplified DNA was sequenced, and the sequence of the 16S rRNA of Gb-03 strain was aligned in GenBank database with related available sequences. The nearest identity was those of Loktanella sp. (99%). Relationship between Gb-03 and genus Loktanella was very close (Figure-1) this is shown in the phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA sequence. Based on the biochemical analysis and phylogenetic tree, the isolate was identified as Loktanella sp.   Emended description of the genus Loktanella  The cells are Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, moderately halotolerant, chemoheterotrophic, nonspore-forming and rod-shaped. Motility was observed to be variable among species and when observed, the cells were motile by means of flagella. The cells were cytochrome oxidase and catalase is positive. Colony colors were variable (white, pink, whitish pink, beige or light orange) depending on the species. The optimal temperature for growth was 25\\u00b0C. The dominant fatty acid found on the isolate was C18: 1v7c while Q-10 was the major ubiquinone. The polar lipids were diphosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidyl choline, and phosphatidyl glycerol. DNA G+C contents were 59.1-67.5 mol%. Phylogenetically, the genus belongs to the Rhodobacter group within the class Alphaproteobacteria. The species was identified to be L. salsilacus based on the ememded description of the genus [24].

Algicidal activity  Each of the six isolate (Gb-01, Gb-02, Gb-03, Gb-04, Gb-05 and Gb-06) showed the different percentage of algicidal activity on the different species of Dinoflagellates been tested in this study (Table-3). Among the six isolates, Loktanella sp. Gb-03 was observed to have the highest algicidal activity against a range of the tested bacteria following 24 h incubation, with the highest algicidal activity seen against A. affine, where the algicidal activity was observed to be as high as 95. In view of the fact that the effect of algicidal bacteria on microbial communities have been demonstrated to be clearly hazardous [38], the findings of this study could be of great value, especially when biotic control of HABs becomes necessary.   Conclusion  The isolated marine bacteria in this study showed a powerful algicidal activity against wide range of Dinoflagellates species, indicating the potential of Malaysian marine as a good source of natural algicides, especially in the biotic control of HABs. This appears to be the first study to isolate and investigate marine algicidal bacteria and to investigate their algicidal effect against toxic Dinoflagellates in Malaysian water. The isolate retained algicidal stability at the optimum growth conditions, suggesting that the isolate is capable of being stable especially during the manufacturing process and in the applied area.

The aim of the study was to compare the stunning of cattle with a captive bolt in two abattoirs. We monitored the slaughtering skills by measuring the deviation of the location of the stunning shot hole on the skull from the ideal point and further by measuring the angle of inclination of the stunning shot on the skull from the ideal perpendicular angle. We observed the impact of different slaughter skills on the quality of stunning of animals based on the occurrence of failure to achieve motor paralysis after a stun shot. The failure to collapse occurred significantly more frequently (P < 0.05) in abattoir A than in abattoir B. In both abattoirs there was a higher (P < 0.05) number of bulls failing to collapse than in females (cows and heifers). However, the effect of slaughter skills on the occurrence of signs associated with insufficient stunning was not found. The signs occurred in abattoir A and abattoir B to the same extent. In bulls, the number of animals with signs was higher (P < 0.05) than in females in both abattoirs. The results show that insufficient proficiency of skills in stunning cattle with a captive bolt leads to a higher number of animals failing to collapse after a stun shot. The effect of slaughter skills on the occurrence of signs in bulls and females was not proven; however, in bulls a higher incidence of signs was demonstrated than in females.Bull, cow, slaughter, stunning effectiveness, welfare ACTA VET.

Methods: We extracted publicly available data from official websites, summarized the containment measures implemented in China and India, and assessed their effectiveness. Results: China has responded to the COVID-19 outbreak with strict public health containment measures, including lockdown of Wuhan city, active case tracing, and large-scale testing, ultimately preventing a large increase in daily new cases and maintaining a low mortality rate per million population (as of May 5, 2021, daily new cases were 11 and mortality rate per million population was 3.37). India, although imposing a national lockdown to control the pandemic, has not implemented strict testing, tracking, and quarantine measures due to the overburdened healthcare system. Combined with massive lockdown, it has accelerated human mobility and exacerbated the epidemic, resulting in a rapid increase in daily new cases and a high mortality rate per million population (as of May 5, 2021, daily new cases were 412,431 and mortality rate per million population was 166.79). Conclusion: China and India implemented public health containment measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic based on their national situations. Meanwhile, daily new cases and mortality of COVID-19 also were affected by environmental and socioeconomic. Countries make a comprehensive strategy not only in terms of the biological, pharmaceutical, health, and sanitation sectors but also based on sustainability science and environmental science.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3976,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The influence of different temperature ranges on the reproductive potential of native and exotic species of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) was checked on Galleria mellonella larvae.The native species included Steinernema asiaticum and Heterorhabditis indica whereas exotic species were S. feltiae and H. bacteriophora.G. mellonella larvae were exposed to 300 IJs of each species.After inoculation at different temperatures, the reproductive potential of EPNs increased with increasing temperature and was found to be the best at 25 o C. No EPNs species could reproduce at 5 o C. S. feltiae started reproduction at 10 o C, while all remaining species reproduced at 15 o C or higher temperatures.Maximum numbers of IJs were recovered from H. bacteriophora.Time taken for first emergence of IJs from the host was shortest at 25 o C i.e. 7-8 days in case of S. asiaticum and S. feltiae, while 11-13 days for H. bacteriophora and H. indica.Maximum emergence time was taken by S. feltiae at 10 o C. E ntomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) of both families Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae have already been effectively utilized to manage the numerous insect pests of agricultural importance (Aatif et al., 2015(Aatif et al., , 2016;;Kaya and Gaugler, 1993).These nematodes have shown best performances against soil inhabiting insect pests having cryptic behavior (Wright, 1992;Gaugler, 1988).Closely associated with reproduction of heterorhabditid and steinernematid nematodes are symbiotic bacteria of the genera Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus in the absence of which, the nematodes fail to kill insect or to reproduce (Ehlers, 1996).The bacteria live within the intestine of infective juvenile-stage (IJ) nematodes.When IJs of EPNs find host insect, they enter in the body of host through mouth, anus or spiracles (Poinar, 1979;Mason and Hominick, 1995).After getting inside the insect, EPNs penetrate into the haemolymph, and release bacteria.The bacteria proliferate and make favorable environment for nematode reproduction by providing nutrients and producing antimicrobial substances (Akhurst, 1982).Many abiotic factors affect EPNs but temperature is the most critical one.The infectivity, development and reproduction of EPNs are influenced by temperature (Grewal et al., 1994).Temperature was variable in both time and space.It was noted that the lower temperature caused the inactivity of the IJs (Rutherford et al., 1987).This is due to various enzymes and activity of various metabolic pathways (Fan and Hominick, 1991).  The range of temperature for the development and reproduction of heterorhabditis and steinernematids spp.and for their strains were different (Molyneux, 1983).The objective of the present study was to examine the reproductive potential of four species of EPNs at various temperatures.The study of S. asiaticum in this experiment would be novel.   Materials and methods  Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, H. indica, Steinernema feltiae and S. asiaticum were used for experimentation.Two species of EPNs (H.bacteriophora and S. feltiae) were taken from University of Readings, Readings, UK. S. asiaticum was obtained from NNRC, The larvae of G. mellonella were reared on cereal diet in Nematology Laboratory, Plant Pathology Department, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad (Wiesner, 1993).  EPNs were cultured on G. mellonella larvae.The freshly born EPNs were kept in shallow clear plastic containers with lids with suspension being no more than 1 cm in depth to ensure sufficient oxygen availability at 10\\u00b0C.All hatched juveniles were again cultured every 4 months.For EPNs, only those freshly produced in vitro (less than 2 weeks old) were used.  For the evaluation of reproductive potential of these four species of EPNs, larvae of G. mellonella were inoculated with EPNs species.Larvae were exposed to 300 IJs of each species in a 5cm petri dish.After inoculation petri plates containing inoculated larvae were incubated at various temperatures i.e., 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 o C using different incubators.Dead larvae were transferred to white traps (Woodering and Kaya, 1988;White, 1927) for the recovery of new progenies of IJs.After 7-10 days when new progenies of EPNs came out from dead insect cadaver, their counting was carried out under stereomicroscope (Olympus 5240).Data were recorded on the basis of EPNs reproductive potential inside host.The experiment was conducted under CRD design and there were three replications for each treatment.  All data collected was subjected to statistical analysis by analysis of variance and regression analysis using statistical package Genstat 6.0 for Windows (VSN International Ltd, UK).Graphs were prepared using the Excel for Windows 2007.   Results  ANOVA for establishment of EPNs at various temperature ranges showed that effect of treatments and species was significant (p> 0.05).Interaction of treatments and species was also significant (Table I).The ratio of IJs which were successfully established inside G. mellonella was temperature dependent and differed among species.Our results showed that IJs of any species of EPN could not establish itself inside G. mellonella larvae at 5 o C, while at 10 o C only S. feltiae showed its establishment.The highest percentage of establishment was achieved with S. feltiae at 15 o C, H. indica at 25 o C and with S. asiaticum at 25 o C (Table I).  Time taken for the first emergence of IJs from host was shortest at 25 o C i.e. 7-8 days in the case of S. asiaticum and S. feltiae, while 11-13 days were spent for H. bacteriophora and H. indica.Maximum time taken for emergence of IJs at 10 o C in S. feltiae was 70 days (Table II).There was an inverse relationship between time and temperature for first emergence of IJs.The reproduction rate of H. bacteriophora was significantly higher than all three EPNs species.It was followed by H. indica and S. feltiae while the reproduction rate of S. asiaticum was the lowest among all the species evaluated.There was no reproduction of any species at 5 o C, while at 10 o C only S. feltiae could reproduce.All other species like H. bacteriophora, H. indica and S. asiaticum started reproduction at 15 o C. The rate of reproduction of S. feltiae was lower at higher temperature (25 o C), while the reproductive potential of all other species showed increasing trends with increase of temperature (Fig. 1).   Discussion  On the basis of the recent work, it is suggested that the differences among four species regarding their establishment and reproductive rates are either due to their mutualistic bacteria or temperature or the combined effect of both of them, because in the absence of symbiotic bacteria, the nematodes fail to kill insect or to reproduce (Ehlers, 1996).The conserved nature of nematode thermal niche breadth would support the hypothesis that temperature activity ranges of different species represent the climatic conditions of their original locality.Tolerance to warm temperatures by H. indica and S. asiaticum suggest tropical origins.Our results collaborate the findings of Grewal et al. (1994) who reported S. scapterisci, S. riobravis and Steinernema sp. are warm adopted species whereas S. scapterisci was stored better at 10 and 25 o C than at 5 o C. In contrast, S. feltiae is a species of temperate origin and can infect insects between 8-30 o C and reproduce between 10-25 o C. Thermal adjustment of EPNs can be supported through effective survival strategies.S. carpocapsae is not active at lower temperature (Molyneux, 1986), cannot reproduce below 15 o C, but still is found in cooler areas.Grewal et al. (1994) reported that S. carpocapsae can penetrate the insect at 10 o C, rest within living host for prolonged times and when temperature increases it restarts its normal growth.Therefore, it may be capable of overwintering in the hosts.Variations among temperature adaptation may result in host specialization among EPNs.The species adjusted to lower temperature reproduction like S. feltiae would be effective insect parasites which are active in winter.Species adjusted to warmer temperature reproduction like H. indica and S. asiaticum would kill insects which are active during summer.The recent study revealing the optimum temperature for reproduction will be helpful in mass production of EPNs and their use in IPM programs in Pakistan.    ://dx.doi.org/10.17582/journal.pjz/2017.49.1.sc12Karachi and H. indica was obtained from Nematology Laboratory, Plant Pathology Department, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad.

Although various approaches have been adopted for the eradication of malaria, still it remains a major health concern, particularly where it acquires an endemic dimension. Thus, malaria has drawn the attention of many researchers, especially in developing countries. This is due to the death of the children, pregnant women, and HIV-infected patients due to malaria [1]. According to the WHO, the worldwide total number of 219 million cases of malaria were reported in 2017 and out of the reported cases, 435,000 clinical death occurred. Although the disease is reported worldwide, yet most affected areas are tropical and subtropical regions. The causative organism of malaria is a protozoan pathogen of Plasmodium species. Malaria in humans is caused by four species of Plasmodium, e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale. However, 5th species of Plasmodium is also reported, which normally infects animals; it is P. knowlesi. Malaria is transmitted by Plasmodium-infected female anopheles bites. Infected female anopheles injects sporozoite into the blood during its blood meal. Sporozoites travel through the vasculature from the skin and infect liver [2].  The possibility of complete elimination and protection against malaria needs some effective antimalarial vaccine to be developed against the pre-erythrocytic stage of the cycle that may offer effective protection. The emergence of resistance against drugs and evasion of immune could lead to excessively high morbidity and mortality. It is not only drug resistance that is developed by the parasite but also pathogen borne toxicity; thus, they are a major concern. Other factors including patient compliance, misdiagnosis, incorrect dosing, poor drug quality, and poor living conditions taken together are responsible for the failure of malaria treatment. Therefore, this seems to be an imperative that delivery systems based on the current cutting edge technologies should be developed capable of circumventing the possibilities of drug resistance development. Because of various drawbacks of present malaria treatment as highlighted above, it is desirable that an attempt should be made to replace conventional monotherapy with combination therapy which reportedly reduces the occurrence of drug resistance. However, combination therapy too could not assure complete eradication of malaria infection [3]. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) have become a primary clinical choice which results in rapid clearance of parasite. The combination therapy, however, appears to be costly and also suffers some added side effects. It is also dependent on the socioeconomic condition, drug-drug interaction, drug-food interactions, lacking the drug quality distributed in the malarious region, and self-medication which add to the existing challenges. Nevertheless, gene sequencing of P. falciparum and advancement in malaria genetics present several novel molecular targets for effective drug designing and also for targeted drug delivery [4]. Currently, various pharmaceutical companies and research agencies are involved in the drug discovery and development process of antimalarial therapy, which could be accomplished with the advancements of novel drugs with better pharmacokinetic profile and costeffectiveness and also suitable for the children and pregnant women [3]. Figure 1 shows the schematic representation of drawbacks of current antimalarial drug therapy.   Strategies for drug targeting  Drugs enter within the RBCs cell through diffusion across the cell membrane, which is composed of amphipathic lipids such as phospholipids and cholesterol organized in a bilayer. The erythrocytic membrane also contains proteins, which serve as receptors and transporters. Hence, antimalarial drugs can reach their target either by carrier-mediated transportation or diffusion through lipid membrane. Carrier-mediated transportation is referred to as facilitated diffusion in case energy is not utilized or active transport if energy is consumed in the process. Carrier-mediated transportation is saturable, subjected to inhibition and stereospecific. Uncharged chemicals exhibit lipid-based diffusion; however, charged molecules are not able to cross the lipid membrane [5].  Plasmodium parasite resides within the RBCs thus escapes the host immune system. Therefore, to target the Plasmodium, the drug must cross various membranous barriers i.e. the RBCs membrane, parasitophorous vacuolar membrane, the plasma membrane of parasite, and depending on the targeting site i.e. food vacuolar membrane or apicoplast membrane. To achieve high parasite clearance rate, optimum plasma drug concentration should be attained at target, i.e., infected RBCs. Figure 2 represents the membranous systems required to be surpassed by the nanocarrier to reach the target site.  The drug targeting aims to achieve high drug concentration at the target site i.e. RBCs or liver cells to prevent the systemic side effects of the drug, caused by the non-specific biodistribution of drugs and able to enhance the drug efficacy. Nanocarriers are below < 1000 nm in size. They are essentially colloidal nanoparticles characterized by high surface area to volume ratio [6]. Nanocarriers should be designed appreciating some important parameters including plasma concentration which is directly proportional to the toxic effects of the drugs and efficacy that in turn directly correlates with the area under the curve (AUC). Thus, to alter the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug and achieve high drug concentration at the target site, these parameters become of paramount significance. PEGylated nanocarriers reportedly enhance the drug efficacy, reduce the dose of the drug, reduce the dosage frequency, and improve the AUC of the drug. The contact period or circulation time of nanocarrier is of importance in the treatment of malaria. Long circulation time enhances the interaction between RBCs and nanocarriers, ultimately leading to iRBCs specific targeting and improved efficacy [7]. The exact mechanism by which nanocarrier contained antimalarials are delivered to the infected RBCs is not clear. There are two proposed mechanisms, referred to as the traditional sequence pathway and a parallel pathway. Infected RBCs become leakier as compared with the normal RBC to fulfill their nutritional requirements from the extra RBC environment (fluid). Nanocarrier which is of the size below < 80 nm diameter may have direct access to the infected RBCs due to their leakiness. Thus, nanocarriers reach within the infected RBCs along with the contents. Selectivity could also be achieved by exploring this proposed mechanism because normal RBCs do not have a leaky membrane and hence a nanocarrier may enter directly into the infected RBCs only. Another proposed mechanism is membrane fusion, i.e., a drug bearing formulation fuses with iRBC membrane. There is a basic dissimilarity between these two pathways about the role of the cytosol of RBC. In the first proposed mechanism, nanocarrier is noticed to bypass the cytosol of RBC; in contrast, drug molecule passes through the cytosol in case of the second mechanism. New permeation pathways (NPP) are responsible for enhanced permeability of iRBCs to a small solute. Tubovesicular membrane (TVM) arises from the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane that extends up to RBC membrane [8] (Fig. 3). TVM is near NPP, so nanocarrier having a size below 80 nm may sink directly into parasite while escaping the cytosol of RBCs. The secondary mechanism involves membrane fusion and active targeting to the iRBCs. In this mechanism, the drug enters the parasite via cytosol of the iRBC [9].  There are two strategies for targeting infected RBCs viz. passive targeting and active targeting. Passive drug targeting is achieved by the use of conventional nanocarriers, i.e., polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, or long-circulating nanocarriers (PEGylated). Active drug targeting on the other hand is achieved by the surface activation of the nanocarriers by using specific ligands to the infected RBCs associated receptors such as ligands include carbohydrate, peptide, or antibodies and proteins [10]. Figure 4 diagrammatically represents the phenomenon of active and passive targeting.  3 Diagrammatically presentation of the proposed mechanism for drug uptake. (a) Parallel pathway in which nanocarrier having size range of below 80 nm reaches directly to the parasite and escaping host cell cytoplam. This is due to the \\\"leakiness\\\" of the infected RBC membrane. New permeation pathways (NPP) arises on the host cell membrane (HCM), which is in close pruximity eith tubulovesicular network (TVN). TVN arises in the cytoplasm of RBC to access the nutrients from the extracellular medium. (b) Traditional sequence pathway: nanocarrier interacts with the receptor expressed on the iRBC membrane and then sequence crosses the host cell membrane (HCM), paracitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM), and then parasite plasma membrane (PPM) to reach its target side    Passive drug targeting  Nanocarrier-based passive targeting leads to accumulation of carrier drug in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) predominant organ. Such carriers are not specifically designed due to their defined size, charge, shape, and nature of material intercepted and captured by phagocytic cells of RES prominent organs and also circulatory phagocytic cells. The phenomenon has a unique spin-off in case of carcinoma where the leaky neovasculature exists. Due to leakiness of tumorassociated vessels, a nanocarrier retained at tumor site and thus yielding comparatively better therapeutic effects due to target accumulation of carrier and hence the drug. The permeation associated phenomenon may also operate in case of iRBCs which are leaky to meet out the requirements of nutrients specifically by needed parasite. However, no systematic studies are available in the literature on iRBCs membraneassociated that are pores, their size and their role in nutrients capture and supply. Nevertheless, the altered permeability phenomenon of iRBCs is well defined and determined that may subserve as a biomodule for passive drug targeting to such cellular destination [7].  Surface properties at large determine the internalization of the nanocarriers in the cells together with their circulation time in blood. Alteration of the surface properties of nanocarriers such as PEGylation prevents its opsonization and further clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) [11]. PEGylation is the phenomenon where nanocarriers are modified with the covalent conjugation with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Moreover, circulation time also increases by an increase in the molecular weight of the PEG chain. PEGylation is used to overcome various drawbacks associated with the biopharmaceutical parameters of a drug/carrier such as pharmacokinetic properties, drug solubility, immunogenicity, and low retention time. It enhances the retention time of the nanocarrier in the blood which is a prerequisite in the case of malaria [12]. Raza et al. prepared the long circulatory liposomal formulation of maduramicin, which exhibited excellent growth inhibition of blood-stage P. falciparum parasite in culture and cures murine model of experimental malaria. They reported that maduramicin in the PEGylated liposomal formulation shows enhanced antiplasmodial activity in vitro compared with the plain maduramicin. It is active against a chloroquine-resistant murine model of malaria and devoid of toxic effects and could prevent the progression of the disease. It also displayed an extended plasma clearance rate, which enhances and favors drug accumulation particularly in infected RBCs [13]. Table 1 summarizes some of the antimalarial formulations which are based on passive drug targeting mechanism.   Active drug targeting  Nanocarriers are designed to enhance the efficacy of treatment wherein drug targeting is of particular importance. Active (1) Passive drug targeting achieved by conventional nanicarriers such as liposome, polymeric nanoparticles, and long-circulating nanocarriers (PEGylated), (2) active drug targeting which is achieved by the nanocarriers modified with the ligands suvh as carbohydrate, protein, peptide, or antibodies drug targeting can restrict the non-specific distribution of drugs to the other organs and thus decreases the side effects. Currently, carrier-based drug targeting employing nanoparticles, liposomes, NLCs, nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, and cyclodextrin has been studied and exploited for malaria treatment. Apart from these specific ligands such as carbohydrates, antibodies, peptides, or protein have been conjugated with nanocarriers, which specifically present the delivery system to the target site. Thus, active drug targeting can maximize the therapeutic effects and seemingly emerge as a promising and attractive strategy [20].  Active targeting can be achieved by the use of carbohydrate as a ligand. An intracellular pathogen can impart various modifications in the host cell to ensure their development and survival. Blood stage of the Plasmodium parasite relies on glycolysis, as the main source of ATP production. Thus, glucose is a major need of the Plasmodium parasite and to fulfill its need hexose transporters 1 (PfHT1) are expressed on the surface of the iRBCs. PfHT1 and the mammalian glucose transporter (GLUT-1) are overexpressed on the infected erythrocyte, for increased uptake of glucose [21]. Shafi et al. use carbohydrates as a ligand to specifically target the infected RBCs. Dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) exhibits competitive behavior with glucose for GLUT-1 binding. They prepared chloroquine-loaded chitosan nanoparticle with 170-200 nm in size with 50-57% entrapment efficiency. CSN is superior in terms of uptake and preferential targeting to the infected RBCs as compared with normal RBC. Parasite inhibition was achieved at 1 nM concentration, while free drug exhibited a comparative activity at 100 nM. It is convincing that specific targeting can reduce the dose and overcome the efflux-based drug resistance [22]. Table 2 summarizes some of the antimalarial formulations which are based on active drug targeting mechanism.   Nanotechnology in the treatment of malaria  Targeted drug delivery systems can deliver the antimalarial drug selectively to the specific target, i.e., iRBCs. This is achieved by both active and passive targeting. As we discussed earlier, nanotechnology addresses various drawbacks including low oral bioavailability, short half-life, poor water solubility, the emergence of drug resistance, and nonspecific drug targeting. Nanosized carriers have drawn the attention of many researchers for their ability to minimize the side effects associated with conventional drug therapy. The goal of the nanocarriers is to protect the drug or vaccine against extracellular degradation and enhance target specific delivery thus decreasing the frequency of administration with improved efficacy and dosage regimen [30]. 6. Artesunate Nanocapsule Artesunate-heparin conjugated nanocapsules (ART-HEP-NCPs) inhibited in vitro P. falciparum 3D7 and an extended circulation in blood. [19] The advantages of nanocarriers as drug delivery systems (a) Exhibit specific targeting leading to higher intracellular accumulation of drug(s). (e) The frequency of administration and duration of the treatment can be reduced. (f) Particle aggregation or blockage of the fine blood capillaries does not occur and hence can be administered by the intravenous route. (g) Nowadays, researchers from various multi-and interdisciplinary areas such as pharmacochemistry, toxicology, and pharmacology are involved in the development of the targeted drug delivery, which is based on the extensive research experience in the various fields, thus promising outcomes are expected [30].  [29] The nanotechnology can be a boon in the treatment of malaria. The present review discusses various nanocarriers commonly used for targeted drug delivery to infected RBCs.   Lipid-based drug delivery carriers  Lipid is a preferred choice as a drug vehicle due to its physiological compatibility. Lipid carriers include various ingredients like cholesterol, triglyceride, phospholipid, and fatty acid. Furthermore, lipid carriers offer various advantages over polymeric carriers such as the sustained release of the hydrophobic drugs, cost-effective, fewer chances of erosion of matrix, and most importantly the biocompatibility. The drug delivery systems that utilize various lipid carriers are liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), and self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) [31].   Liposome as a nanocarrier  Liposomes are the spherical vesicles made up of phospholipids assembled in the bilayers. Liposomes can be used for the encapsulation of single or more drugs. Due to their bilayer structure, hydrophobic drugs can be incorporated in the lipid bilayers while hydrophilic drugs in or within the aqueous core [32]. Plain liposome or PEGylated liposome is extensively studied as a nanocarrier for the treatment of malaria. Liposomes are superior to nanoparticles in regard to the therapeutic index of the antimalarial drugs. They could enhance the circulation time and decrease the intrinsic toxicity and immunogenicity. PEGylation as such offers an additional advantage of enhancing the circulation time of liposomes. Thus, liposomes attracted immense attention of researchers for their potential in the treatment of malaria.  Ismail and coworkers encapsulated artesunate and its derivative into the liposomes and administered by i.v. route. They exhibited excellent in vivo results. The dimerization and self-assembly strategies were used to prepare novel amphiphilic dimeric artesunate phospholipid (Di-ART-GPC) conjugate-based liposomes. This unique approach demonstrated appreciably high drug loading and better pharmacokinetic properties. The pharmacokinetic studies reveal that liposomes and conjugate have a greater retention time in the blood. Di-ART-GPC liposomes and conjugate exhibit IC50 value of 0.39 nM and 1.90 nM respectively and better in vitro antiplasmodial activities without causing hemolysis. Free ART-and conventional ART-loaded liposomes show IC50 value of 5.17 nM and 3.13 nM respectively. The liposomes could increase the extent of parasite eradication in P. berghei-infected mice in vivo and delayed recrudescence and enhanced survival as compared with the free artesunate [33].  Liposomes could also deliver both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs simultaneously. In combination therapy, two different drugs with different modes of action can be administered simultaneously that reduce the occurrence of drug resistance and enhance the efficacy of treatment regimen. Biosca et al. have reported a immunoliposome-based nanocarrier that incorporates both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. For targeting Plasmodium-infected RBCs, the gametocytes antibodies against glycophorin A were used. Gametocyte blocking drugs such as pyronaridine and atovaquone were co-encapsulated in the glycophorin Atargeted immunoliposomes. It exhibited significantly higher activity as compared with the free drug, in vitro resulting in 50% inhibition of the growth of the parasite [25].  Antimalarial activity of monensin was reported by the Rajendran et al. They prepared liposomes using soyaphosphatidyl choline cholesterol containing either stearylamine or phosphatidic acid and different mole fractions of distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine-methoxy-PEG 2000. In vitro and in vivo activity of the developed formulation was studied on Plasmodium falciparum cultures and murine models of Plasmodium berghei respectively. It was found to be superior to free monensin when compared. The IC50 values of 0.74 nM and 0.39 nM for the SA liposome and SPC:Chol-liposome with 5 mol% DSPE-mPEG 2000 respectively were recorded, which was lower than the free monensin (3.17 nM), and it did not show hemolysis; thus antiplasmodial activity of SA liposome and SPC:Chol-liposome with 5 mol% DSPE-mPEG 2000 was greater than free monensin formulation. Long circulatory liposomes of the monensin with 5 mol% DSPE-mPEG 2000 in combination with free artemisinin show greater parasite clearance, recrudescence inhibition, and enhanced survival [18].  Apart from the treatment, the liposomal formulation can also be used in the diagnosis of cerebral malaria (CM). CM is a severe form of malaria which is caused by the P. falciparum. Misdiagnosis or late diagnosis often delays the treatment that leads to mortality. Thus, to overcome these issues, Portnoy et al. have prepared liposomes containing an FDA approved fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG) for the diagnosis of CM in a murine model. Emission intensities of the liposomal formulation were high as compared with the free ICG. ICG bearing liposomes showed higher emission in the brain of the infected mice as compared with the control mice and drug-treated mice. Histopathological analysis revealed that accumulation of formulation in the vasculature of the brain is due to extensive uptake of liposomes by the activated macrophages. Thus, it can be a valuable diagnostic tool and biomarker for early detection of CM [34].  Parnham et al. reported screening of the liposomes for toxicity. Potential toxicity of the liposomes can be due to the metabolism of liposomal constituents. Various in vitro and in vivo tests such as thrombosis, hemolysis, cytotoxicity to L1210 mouse leukemia cells, platelet aggregation, phagocytic index, pyrogenicity, acute parenteral toxicity, and local tolerance have been carried out to rule out potential toxicity of liposomes. Hypersensitivity, however, still remains a possible toxicological risk with drugs that are administered repeatedly. However, in this context, liposomes offer various advantages over other carriers. Nevertheless, for research purposes, simple toxicity tests are sufficient; unfortunately, these simple toxicity tests are not sufficient at the advanced stages of malaria. Extensive testing of the liposomes reveals that it is safe for pharmaceutical use [35].  Liposomes are a well-established drug delivery system that could be tailored with various ranges, in terms of morphology and surface charge. They can be used for the encapsulation of hydrophilic/hydrophobic drugs. Liposomes can be formulated as a long circulatory carrier that has already exhibited better therapeutic outcomes. Thus, they hold great potential and promise to be an efficacious option adaptable for clinical application. Moreover, they should also be studied for the intrinsic toxicology in a systematic manner.  On the basis of studies as above, it can be appreciated that products based on phospholipids are a relatively safe therapeutic option and also they provide biochemically modulated targeting, wherein the lipid counterpart is an essential/ nutritional and biochemical need of parasite. To thrive upon within infected RBCs, it is a prerequisite to uptake circulatory lipids drug conjugate, which leads to infected RBCs specific drug targeting. Product as well as a carrier i.e. liposomes are seemingly devoid of toxicological implications, and represent for scientifically well-founded strategies. Nevertheless, after systematic toxicological studies, it may become the clinical reality with better clinical results of the coming future.   Nanostructured lipid carrier as a nanocarrier  As an alternative to the liposomes, emulsions, polymeric nanoparticles, and lipid nanocarriers have been explored as a drug delivery system. These are the 2nd generation lipid carriers, developed and studied to circumvent the drawbacks associated with solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). NLCs are promising carriers that can incorporate hydrophobic drugs and also they are biocompatible. The NLCs have superior characteristics as compared with other lipid formulations. NLCs are composed of a mixture of lipids as liquid and solid phases that form a liquid lipid matrix, where the drug is accommodated; and hence superior characters in terms of drug stability and release characterstics are achieved [35].  Lipids play a classical role in the life cycle of Plasmodium. Lipid metabolism is not significant in the normal RBCs while its demand is increased significantly in the case of iRBCs. In order to fulfill this demand, the uptake of the lipid occurs from the host. The normal RBCs and iRBCs can be distinguished based on their lipid requirement. Based on this principle, Jain et al. prepared a glyceryl-dilaurate nano lipid carriers (GDL-NLCs) for the delivery of antimalarials and tested them in a murine malaria model. Infected RBCs were selectively targeted and impaired by the GDL-NLCs. GDL was used as a targeting ligand GDL-NLCs was primarily accumulated within the mitochondria of the Plasmodium. This leads to the mitochondrial membrane polarization, Ca 2+ ion accumulation, ROS release, and stage-specific lysis of the infected RBCs. GDL-NLCs also promoted the clearance of infected RBCs by the macrophages. It also disrupts the Plasmodium TVN, which is essential for the import of nutrients from the host. Optical trap studies demonstrated that GDL-NLCs restore the flexibility of the infected RBCs. The NLCs can entrap hydrophobic drugs and selectively target them to the iRBCs and hence may be a potent drug delivery carrier for the treatment of malaria [28].  Another study by Baruah et al. reports chloroquine-loaded NLCs. Chloroquine is the most widely used antimalarial for its various properties such as efficiency, stability, safety, and low cost. However, the emergence of resistance against chloroquine limits its uses. The CQ-NLCs could increase antimalarial efficacy with rapid parasitic clearance. Thus, loading of the antimalarials in the NLCs overcomes the drawbacks associated with the available conventional drugs [36].  Artemether-lumefantrine (ARM-LFN) is a WHOapproved fixed-dose combination which suffers oral bioavailability and solubility issues. The NLCs were prepared by Prabhu et al. to overcome these issues. WHO recommends the adult therapeutic dose of 80 mg for ARM and 480 mg for LFN (4 tablets) two times in a day. ARM-LFN NLCs were administered at the 1/5 of the conventional therapeutic dose (16 mg ARM and 96 mg LFN), which exhibited total parasite clearance and complete survival of P. berghei-infected mice. NLCs exhibited an increased efficacy at 1/10 daily dose of ARM-LFN. The 1/10 reduced the daily dose incorporated in two soft gelatin capsules. The capsule exhibits better stability at room temperature for a year. Thus, NLCs due to its biocompatible nature would be promising strategies for malaria therapy [37]. Table 3 summarizes some of the nanostructured lipid carrier-based antimalarial formulations.  The strategies and related literature reveal that NLCs are biocompatible and appropriate system for poorly watersoluble drugs. They have intrinsic targetability towards the cell i.e. iRBCs owing to their lipoidal nature, which satisfies the biochemical need of parasite. Thus, they may result in efficacious drug delivery system specifically suited to drugs which because of their solubility cannot be formulated in parenteral form or cleared fast by the circulation thus limited for their use. Nevertheless, such a system also needs elaborated studies relating to toxicology.   Solid lipid nanoparticles as a nanocarrier  SLNs were developed as an alternative to lipid-based nanocarriers such as liposomes, emulsions, micelles, and polymeric nanoparticles. Various biocompatible lipids used in the preparation of SLNs include precirol, cetyl alcohol, compritol, glyceryl monostearate, cetyl palmitate, stearic acid, tristearin, and trimyristin. SLNs can be synthesized without using toxic organic solvents. Thus, SLNs meet the requirement of the optimum drug delivery system for the incorporation of the lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs [41].  Heparin-functionalized nanocarriers can selectively target the iRBCs. Incorporation of the heparin enhances the stealth character and efficiently allows to bypass the reticuloendothelial system vis-to-vis an enhanced targeting of drugs with increased uptake and accumulation in the iRBCs. Heparin also synergizes the action of antimalarial drugs due to its intrinsic antimalarial activity. Chloroquine-loaded heparin-surfaced functionalized SLNs were prepared by the Muga et al. and evaluated in vitro against chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains. IC50 value of CQ-SLN and CQ-Hep-SLN was found to be 4.72 \\u00b1 0.14 ng/ mL and 2.41 \\u00b1 0.27 ng/mL respectively. These findings suggest that SLNs have superior in vitro activity than chloroquine when tested on chloroquine-sensitive parasite [29].  Muller et al. reported in vitro cytotoxicity studies of the SLNs as a function of lipid matrix and surfactant. For the lipid matrix Dynasan 114 and compritol ATO 888 concentration is used and tween 80, poloxamers, sodium dodecyl sulphate and soya lecithin is used as a surfactant. Cytotoxicity studies were carried out by measuring the viability of HL60 cells and human granulocytes. Chemiluminescence measurements were carried out to quantify the particle internalization. The results revealed that viability does not get affected by the nature of lipid. Following binding to the SLNs surface, the cytotoxic effect of surfactants such as poloxamer tends to decrease significantly. Thus, SLNs exhibited relatively low cytotoxicity as compared with other nanoparticles, i.e., polylactic/ glycolic acid and polyalkylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles. Thus, SLNs demonstrated great potential as a drug carrier system for the intravenous administration [42].  SLNs can be explored for oral as well as parental administration; they may improve the solubility of poorly aqueous soluble drug and hence their bioavailability. Furthermore, they can be fabricated for active drug targeting in case they are designed for target-oriented drug delivery. The issue related to drug payload, plasma protein interaction, targetability, nonspecific accumulation in organs, circulatory half-life, dose computation, patient compliance, and toxicological implications is required to be studied.  Self-microemulsifying drug delivery system as a nanocarrier Self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) is a stable mixture of active medicaments, surfactants, co-surfactant, and oil. Although SMEDDS are the SEDDS, which are arranged in the form of fine oil globules in water (o/w) and droplets with a diameter smaller than 50 nm on mild agitation in the GI tract are produced. Poorly water-soluble drugs can be effectively delivered and also the system may prevent drug degradation in the GIT. SMEDDS provides the larger surface area for the diffusion of the drug [43]. Primaquine is a gametocytocidal which is used to prevent transmission of malaria by preventing the spread of malaria. Primaquine, however, has some drawbacks like short halflife (5.6 h), first-pass metabolism, and dose-dependent side effects such as leukocytosis, methanoglobenmia, leukocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia in G6PD-deficient patients. Thus, frequent administration of primaquine (PQ) is needed and sometimes it shows some severe adverse effects. To overcome these issues, PQ was encapsulated in the SMEDDS to achieve higher therapeutic efficacy. Chudiwal and coworkers delivered the primaquine (PQ) as a SMEDDS to enhance liver uptake and increase efficacy against the liver stages of P. vivax. Pharmacodynamic efficacy was evaluated by applying Peter 's Four Day Suppressive Test in a murine model. SMEDDS show higher antimalarial efficacy than marketed formulations. Results of biodistribution studies suggest that SMEDDS are specifically targeted to the liver [44]. Thus, it is a suitable carrier for liver-stage malaria.  Another study was carried out by Bhandari et al. to enhance the oral bioavailability of the artemether and lumefantrine. SMEDDS could increase aqueous solubility, which led to enhanced absorption. Optimized formulation was adsorbed on the Neusilin US2\\u00ae using a spray drying technique for conversion into solid SMEDDS. Ninety percent of the artemether and lumefantrine were released in 15 min in the dissolution media. Globule size of the SMEDDS was 67.74 nm. The formulation released the contents at a faster rate in vivo as compared with the marketed tablets [45].  Curcumin and artemisinin show poor aqueous solubility, which leads to poor oral bioavailability. SMEDDS significantly improve the solubility of curcumin (4.4 mg/3 mL) and artemisinin (73.4 mg/3 mL). The optimized formulation consisted of Tween 80, PEG 400, and oleic acid. The dissolution study reveals that curcumin and artemisinin dissolved up to 63.81% and 54.91% respectively in 1.2 pH within 1.5 h. These studies demonstrated that SMEDDS has potential as an alternative to the conventional formulation of curcumin and artemisinin [46]. SMEDDS could be administered orally for lymphatic transportation and absorption. The materials used in their preparation are at large FDA approved. Thus, after, appropriate toxicological studies such a system(s) could be explored for their clinical application. Table 4 summarizes some of the self-emulsifying drug delivery system(s) (SEDDS)-based antimalarial formulations.   Polymer-based nanocarriers  Polymer-based nanocarriers offer several advantages such as enhanced bioavailability, good biocompatibility, increased drug solubility, and reduced toxicity. Various polymer-based nanocarriers are polymeric nanoparticle, dendrimers, hydrogels, etc. [1].  Drug resistance is the major concern in the case of malaria; the nanotechnological attempts have been made to overcome chloroquine resistance. Dextran is a biopolymer which is approved by the US-FDA for i.v. administration. iRBCs allow access to the macromolecules as nutrients via the parasitophorous duct. Kashyap et al. prepared chloroquine dextrin nanoparticles (CHQ-DEX-NPs) by the solvent diffusion method, which are directly taken up by the iRBCs through parasitophorous duct arriving at a therapeutic concentration at the target side. IC50 value of the CHQ-DEX-NPs in sensitive 3D7 and resistant RKL9 P. falciparum strain was 0.031 \\u03bcg/mL and 0.13 \\u03bcg/mL, which is significantly less than 0.059 \\u03bcg/mL and 0.36 \\u03bcg/mL of free drug [51].  Helmut Ringsdorf was first to introduce a polymer-based delivery system. Low molecular weight drug or hydrophobic bioactive agents were covalently linked with a hydrophilic polymeric carrier. Currently, polymer-drug conjugates are being used as drug delivery systems. The targeting moiety and solubilizing agents are also incorporated into the polymerdrug carriers, which further enhance the therapeutic efficacy of the bioactive. Various drawbacks associated with the current antimalarial drugs include drug toxicity, multiple drug resistance, low bioavailability, poor water solubility, and biodegradability. A polymer-drug conjugate increases bioavailability and biodegradability. The polymer-based carriers could improve the water solubility of active medicament and could effectively deliver the bioactive(s) at the target site(s). Pharmacodynamics and pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of drugs thus got improved when administered as polymer-drug conjugate [52].  Alven et al. have combined antibiotics with antimalarials applying polymer-drug conjugation, which provided synergistic effects. They have conjugated and incorporated antibiotics and antimalarials together onto a polyaspartamide molecule. The conjugate formation was confirmed by FTIR, 1HNMR, SEM, and XRD pattern. The conjugate exhibited amorphous nature and drug was found to be associated with the polymer(s) in chemically conjugated form. The antimalarial activity against the asexual phase of Plasmodium was recorded with 35.6-99.9 of percentage inhibition when tested in varied concentrations, i.e., 1 to 5 \\u03bcM. The antimalarial activity of the polymer-drug conjugate has been noticeably higher as compared with free drug. The resulted synergistic action confirmed a potentiating effect of the antibiotic. Thus, these findings suggest that polymer-drug conjugate could be an attractive alternative for malaria treatment [53].  Apart from the delivery system, polymer can also generate a potent immune effect by serving as an adjuvant. Scaria et al. have conjugated malaria antigen to a protein carrier, which provided on enhanced immunogenicity of the antigen. Malaria antigen is chemically conjugated with a carrier protein; this forms nanoparticles with greater immunogenicity. They used Pfs25 and Pfs230D1 malaria antigens separately linked to the carrier protein Exoprotein A (EPA) via thioester bond. These nanoparticles provide greater immunogenicity. Various conjugates have been reportedly prepared by using amide, glutaraldehyde, thioester, and ADH chemistry and characterized for Mw distribution, average Mw, and humoral immunogenicity evaluated in mice. The conjugate was 16-73 nm in size. These findings suggest that various carriers and appropriate chemistry can be used for protein-protein conjugation for effective vaccine development [54].  Polymer-based nanocarriers possess added advantages of in vivo drug release control, if they are appropriately sized and material is biodegradable could be further explored for clinical application. Nevertheless, size and surface charge are required to be evaluated for their role in nanotoxicological manifestation before they can be the acceptable drug delivery system. Some of the polymeric-based nanocarriers are summarized in Table 5.   Prodrugs as an antimalarial  Prodrugs are chemically altered inactive drug molecules, which require chemical or enzymatic biotransformation in the body, to release their active parent drug, at the site of action where therapeutic effect is needed. Prodrugs are classified as carrier-linked prodrugs and bioprecursors. The pharmacologically active drug is attached to the carrier by a covalent bond, which is released under in vivo conditions. In contrast, bioprecursors are activated by the metabolic transformations of the functional group. Prodrug strategy is employed where a drug possesses a poor pharmacokinetic profile or where sitespecific targeted delivery is needed. Various physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and biopharmaceutical properties like solubility, chemical stability, bioavailability, permeability, and metabolism are improved by applying prodrug approach [59].  A study carried out by Ismail et al. seems to be an interesting strategy to target iRBCs. They have reported the liposome of dimeric artesunate phospholipid, where one molecule of phospholipid could deliver simultaneously two molecules of artesunate to the iRBCs. The hypothesis is based on the demand of the lipids, which are dramatically increased during the various biological processes of Plasmodium parasite. Hence, infected RBCs can be selectively targeted via this approach. Figure 5 shows a schematic representation of targeting iRBCs via prodrug approach [33].  Some of the important prodrugs of antimalarials are summarized in Table 6.   Protein/nucleic acid-based drug delivery  Peptides exhibit high biocompatibility hence could be the material of choice for preparation of nano-drug delivery system. Curcumin is an antimalarial agent but due to its low solubility and less bioavailability, the in vivo efficacy of the curcumin is c o m p r o m i s e d . A l a m a n d c o w o r k e r s r e p o r t e d dehydrophenylalanine (\\u0394Phe) dipeptide-based self- The solubility of artemether is enhanced. [47] \\u03b2-Artemether SMEDDS Oral  The antimalarial activity was significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) as compared with the marketed formulation (Larither\\u00ae). [48] \\u03b2-Artemether and lumefantrine SMEDDS Oral SMEDDS shows superior antimalarial activity with 100% survival as compared with the innovator (Coartem\\u00ae) formulation.  [49]  Artemether-lumefantrine Solid SMEDDS Oral Optimized SMEDDS formulation at a low, medium, and high doses found to be superior in terms of reduction in parasitemia as well as mortality in comparison with the marketed tablet of equivalent dose. [50] assembled nanoparticles for the delivery of curcumin. For achieving efficient delivery of curcumin, different dipeptides such as phenylalanine-\\u03b1,\\u03b2-dehydrophenylalanine (F\\u0394F), arginine-\\u03b1,\\u03b2-dehydrophenylalanine (R\\u0394F), valine-\\u03b1,\\u03b2dehydrophenylalanine (V\\u0394F), and methonine-\\u03b1,\\u03b2dehydrophenylalanine (M\\u0394F) which were studies for the self-assembly and curcumin loading capacity reveal that out of them F\\u0394F nanotubes exhibit the highest loading capacity nearly 68% w/w and an IC50 value of 3.0 \\u03bcM. Thus, curcumin-loaded F\\u0394Fnanoformulation shows greater parasite inhibition as compared with free curcumin in malaria-infected mice. The biocompatible short peptide-based nanoparticles appear to be an excellent carrier for the loading of hydrophobic antimalarials [62]. CM is one of the most severe forms of infection of P. falciparum. Microvesicles (MV) play an important role in  Chloroquine and azithromycin Nanospheres Combination therapy exhibits synergistic action against Plasmodium in vitro. The formulation could overcome the problem of drug resistance.  [56]  Bisphosphonates Carbon nanospheres (CNSs)  Chloroquine conjugated bisphosphonates carbon nanospheres (CNSs) exhibited excessively high antiparasitic activity parasite killing.  [57]  Artemisinin   Dimers and dendrimers  Antimalarial activity of the dimer and dendrimer was investigated in the P. falciparum 3D7 strain and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and found to be the most active compound as compared with artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, and chloroquine. Trimer is most active against HCMV in vitro replication and has a EC50 value of 0.026 \\u03bcm. [58] the pathogenesis of CM as a marker of severity. These are the submicron vesicles (200-1000 nm diameter) released from the cells in the microvasculature such as platelets, endothelial cells, erythrocyte, and leucocytes. During CM, neurological symptoms are increased as the level of MV increases. MV analysis gives a strong basis, which helps to understand the pathophysiology of CM. miRNA is the small, non-coding single-stranded RNA, which helps to control 30% of protein-coding genes via post-transcriptional regulation and RNA silencing. microRNA within the MV showed to be dysregulated in malaria. Cohen et al. worked on the microRNA cargo of MV to understand the pathogenesis of CM. miRNA changes were recorded in CBA-infected mice with P. berghei ANKA strain and P. yoelii, which are responsible for severe malaria devoid of cerebral complications hence termed as non-CM. A comparison of the MV with healthy and CM mice for miRNA expression using microarrays was made. The results reveal that miRNA plays an important role in inflammation and dysregulation during CM, which is critical for the beginning of neurological syndrome through the regulation of downstream targets [63]. Clinical development of Pfs25 is hindered due to its limited immunogenicity. It is a transmission-blocking vaccine antigen candidate. Thus, to enhance its immunogenicity, recombinant polyhistidine-tagged Pfs25 is mixed with the preformed liposomes which contain cobalt porphyrin-phospholipid; thus at the time of immunization, nanoliposome antigen particleization (SNAP) 762 formation takes place. The antigen is stably presented on phospholipid bilayer, without covalent modification, and hence retains antigen conformation. The histidine-tagged P. falciparum polypeptide was found to induce strong antibody production and could be useful in the preparation of multistage particulate vaccines using SNAP for immunization [64].  Nanobiotechnology product in the market RTS,S (Mosquirix\\u2122) is the first licensed vaccine of malaria that is approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for young children. RTS,S vaccine is active against P. falciparum, which is the most deadly parasite prevalent globally especially in the Africa region. The vaccine has been approved by the WHO for pilot production in the three African countries (Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi). RTS, S activates body immune system to fight against malaria, especially against P. falciparum. RTS,S is designed to arrest the Plasmodium life cycle (infection, maturation, and multiplication) in the liver [65].  In RTS,S vaccine \\\"R\\\" stands for central repeat region of P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP); \\\"T\\\" stands for a T cell epitope of circumsporozoite protein, and \\\"S\\\" stands for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). It forms a single fusion protein (\\\"RTS\\\") and it is further co-expressed within the yeast vector with free HBsAg. \\\"RTS, S\\\" particles are formed by the spontaneous assembly of the \\\"RTS\\\" fusion protein and free \\\"S\\\" protein. The vaccine also contains adjuvants to enhance the immunogenicity; here, AS01 is used as a adjuvant and hence referred as \\\"RTS,S/AS01\\\" [66].  Adjuvants are added to achieve the desired adaptive immune system. It is defined as functional excipients, possesses a heterogeneous group of compounds, and can be divided into Prodrug did not improve in vivo efficacy but improved drug exposure with oral dosing and longer half-life is achieved. [60] bis-N-Alkylamidines Amidoxime derivatives as a prodrug Choline Amidoxime prodrug significantly improves oral antimalarial activity. [61] two broad category delivery systems or immunostimulators. Delivery systems include liposome, emulsion droplets, and immune-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs). Patternrecognition receptors (PPRs) are expressed on the antigen-presenting cells (APCs), for which co-delivery of antigen on the immunostimulator acts as a ligand. Adjuvant based on the liposomes for subunit vaccine and as immunopotentiator is multifaceted and can be customized combining (a) changing lipid composition, (b) mode of antigen and immunostimulatory association, and (c) addition of immunostimulator. Liposomes act as an adjuvant by their ability to interact with the antigen-presenting cells and increase the exposure of immunostimulator and antigen to the APCs [67].   Future prospects of nanobiotechnology  Nanobiotechnology is an emerging area of research and application being explored for its potential applications to obscure and address drug and drug delivery-related problems. Seemingly, it can improvise the existing conventional drug delivery modules and also it can improve the therapeutic outcome of the drug discernibly and may allow curtailing down the contraindicated manifestations well below the tolerable limits. Most of the nano biotechnological have demonstrated improved and effective performance at preclinical stages. However, the results at the end have been discouraging due to toxicological and interactive manifestations of such drug delivery systems. There appears to be a gap between preclinical and clinical phases inviting intensive, consistent, and sincere attention of researchers to logistically design and develop the systems for their safe and effective use. It is appreciated that the molecular interplay involved in the malaria parasite invasion and its subsequent proliferation and molecular mechanistic involved therein can open up the vistas of multiple options, opportunity, potential, and promises based on molecular events and judicious intervention thereon, which could only be possible through nanobiotechnological stratagems. The target (infected RBCs) could be selectively delivered with a load of drug which could not only eradicate the parasitemia but also the problem associated with drug resistance that emerges due to sub-therapeutic drug exposure. The nanobiotechnology may include the use of site-directing antibodies, aberrant and variant expression of protein determinant on infected cells, biodevices developed as a variant, and bioprocesses and also the smart material which could be developed by structuring a drug/drug(s) carrier selective or with proficiency to the target site. Adding to the proposed possibilities, the molecular modifications as nutrient-based prodrug and antimetabolites could be other possible diversities that can be brought in place in the designing, development, and tailoring of drug delivery systems for exclusive use in cellselective targeted drug delivery.   Conclusion  Scientific innovations, development, and international collaboration have increased the ability for effective treatment of malaria and understanding of etiology at the molecular level. Nanobiotechnology provides various opportunities, which could improve conventional malaria therapy. Poor solubility, low oral bioavailability, toxicity, chemical instability, poor pharmacokinetic properties, the short half-life of the drug, drug resistance, and non-specific drug targeting are the main d r a w b a c k s o f c o n v e n t i o n a l t h e r a p y. H o w e v e r, nanobiotechnology overcomes the abovementioned shortcomings to some extent. The journey ahead is long to recognize an effective combination of molecules, which will enhance therapeutic indices and devoid of side effects. Safety and scalability are two important parameters for targeted antimalarial therapy. Liposomes, especially PEGylated liposomes, seem to be an effective drug delivery system for incorporating antimalarial drugs. The polymeric nanocarriers are less exploited for malaria. Surface modification of the nanocarriers may improve the drug targeting and efficacy of the treatment. The nanobiotechnology thus may help design the smart, well-tolerated, low cost, and effective therapeutic drug delivery systems for the complete eradication of malaria.

There are many sources of pollution, and they are distributed in different ways on our planet. However, air pollutants emitted in one country can be transported into the atmosphere, affecting air quality elsewhere. Suspended particulate matter (PMx), nitrogen dioxide, and tropospheric ozone are considered the three pollutants that most significantly affect human health [3]. For these reasons, PMx measurement is very important, and can be performed using various direct analytical instruments, such as impact samplers and analytical balances [4]. In recent years, systems and sensors for the analysis (or counting) of microparticles or microspheres have been the focus of numerous studies. For the assay, coated microspheres provide a measuring tool in biology and drug research [5]. In buoyancy, hollow microspheres (made of glass and polymer) are used to decrease material density in plastics. For ceramic filter manufacturing, microspheres of polyethylene are used to obtain controlled porosity [6]. In particular, in the field of research for developing PM monitoring devices, monodisperse microspheres are used to calibrate particle sieves, optical particle counters (OPCs), and other kinds of sensors [7]. Generally, OPC performances are comparable when they are used to count particles. On the other hand, the algorithms used to convert the counting into a mass concentration differ from manufacturer to manufacturer. In fact, parameters such as refractive index and particle shape influence their mass estimation. Therefore, the optical measurement has an intrinsic discrepancy when compared to the more accurate direct gravimetric methods [8]. For these reasons, we focused our attention on quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs), which are one of the most commonly used mass sensors for the development of sensory systems designed to measure gases, molecules, particles, and contaminants in a wide range of applications, such as environmental monitoring [9], medical assays, and space applications [10][11][12][13]. QCMs are piezoelectric oscillating-based sensors capable of converting changes in thickness/mass of the deposited material on their electrodes into a frequency shift. QCMs are still being studied as one of the most reliable methods of measurement and analysis for particulate matter in general [14][15][16]. In fact, in PM monitoring, a QCM can measure the mass of the particles collected on its electrodes by providing, for example, the total of PM or fractions such as PM2.5 or PM10 in cascade-type impact meters [17]. Separation or filtering systems [18] and one or more QCM are therefore used to obtain information on the different dimensions of the particulate. Currently, this type of system can be miniaturized, but it poses extreme difficulties given the current state of microfluidics, mechanical, or 3D machining processes [19]. In recent years, QCMs have been at the center of numerous research studies applied to the measurement of the dimensions of microspheres in various fields of application; in fact, many works use them not only as mass sensors, but also as actual transducers for complex analyses of tribology [20,21]. Some scientific works use concepts of energy dissipation of the vibration generated on the surface of the QCM to analyze the type of bond the particle forms with the electrode surface, often functionalized [22]. Other research groups modify the surface of the QCM by building mechanical structures, such as micropillars, that act as mechanical resonators and, when coupled with particles of the correct size, produce changes in the frequency of the QCM distinguishable from the simple signal of an increase in mass or thickness [23]. However, it would be very interesting to be able to use QCMs to measure, at the same time, the mass of particles collected on the surface and perform dimensional analysis. This would prevent PM monitoring systems, based on mass sensors, from always having to use complex or cumbersome dimensional separation systems. In 1971, a study by Olin and Sem [24] was useful in understanding how to write a relationship between the response of a QCM, the resonance frequency, and the amplitude of the vibration when microparticles are deposited on its surface. In this paper, we present an experiment aimed at studying the possible effects that occur on the response of a QCM to different measurements of microspheres when the amplitude of the vibration varies. To simplify the tests, we used borosilicate microspheres, which are usually used in aerosol generators, for atmospheric PM simulation. In detail, we conducted tests on various QCMs, which had three distinct fundamental resonant frequencies (10, 5, 2.5 MHz), measuring the response obtained for two samples of microspheres, 2 and 10 \\u00b5m in diameter, and varying the amplitude of the vibration.  We have obtained encouraging results by developing a circuit capable of controlling the amplitude of the oscillation, acting on the QCM driving current. In particular, with a QCM of 2.5 MHz, we can detect only the mass of the 2 \\u00b5m microspheres, even when 10 \\u00b5m microspheres are present. This result confirms Olin and Sem's study, and could allow the development of a QCM-based system for continuous mass and size analysis of collected particulate matter.    Methods and Materials   Frequency and Driving Force Effects  According to Sauerbrey's experimental assumption, the resonant frequency decreases linearly with the addition of foreign mass on the crystal surface: \\u2206 f = \\u2212 2 f o 2 A \\u221a v q \\u03c1 q \\u2206m = \\u2212 C f A \\u2206m(1) In this equation (Equation (1)), \\u2206f refers to the frequency shift due to the changing mass \\u2206m. C f represents a constant, where f 0 is the fundamental resonating frequency, v q is the velocity of propagation of transverse wave in the plane of the quartz, \\u03c1 q is the density of the quartz, and A is the effective area of the electrode [25].  Although the Sauerbrey assumption is applicable for particles and thin films, some differences in the QCM response were observed due to particles that may have relatively more movement between adjacent particulate layers, causing more energy dissipation [26]. Generally, a particle on a QCM must adhere to the vibrating surface with enough force to counteract the inertia forces to be detected [24,[27][28][29].  The inertia force F I acting on a spherical particle of diameter D p and density \\u03c1 p is defined as: F I = \\u03c1 P \\u03c0 6 \\u03b2I(2\\u03c0 f 0 ) 2 D p 3 (2) where \\u03b2I is the crystal vibration amplitude for a fixed driving current I, and f 0 is the crystal fundamental resonating frequency (\\u03b2 is a constant for a given crystal). The particle adhesion force (F A ) on the surface can be written as: F A = \\u00b5\\u03bbD p(3) where \\u00b5 is the friction coefficient and \\u03bb is a constant depending on the interaction forces between the surface and the particle. When the forces are balanced (F A = F I ), combining Equations (2) and (3), we obtain a critical diameter D crit (for a fixed frequency and a set driving current I): D crit = 3\\u00b5\\u03bb 2\\u03c0 3 \\u03c1 P \\u03b2 1 I 1/2 f 0(4) Equation (4) shows that when F I \\u2264 F A , a particle adheres to the QCM surface, resulting in D p \\u2264 D crit , and it can be detected. On the other hand, it cannot be detected when F I > F A because a particle tends to dislodge from the surface (D p > D crit ). For these reasons, varying the current and frequency makes it possible to change the QCM response to a fixed particle diameter. In order to detect bigger particles, the product I\\u00b7f 0 should be minimized. However, there are physical limits for the driving current and resonating frequency. In particular, the current cannot be less than I Limit (the value required to sustain a stable oscillation), and at the same time, a decreasing resonant frequency produces a QCM response (or sensitivity) reduction.   Reagents and Methods  The chemicals used to prepare the samples, which included three dispersions and one solution, were polyvinylpyrrolidone (MW 1300 kDa, CAS number: 9000-39-8), absolute ethanol (CAS number: 64-17-5) purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), and borosilicate glass microspheres with mean diameters of 2 \\u00b5m and 10 \\u00b5m (traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology) purchased from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) (Cat.no:9002, Cat.no:9010).  Three different dispersions were prepared using absolute ethanol (EtOH) as liquid phase [30]. MS 10  1.4 mg of 2 \\u00b5m microspheres in 10 mL of EtOH, resulting in concentrations of 0.42 \\u00b5g/\\u00b5L and 0.28 \\u00b5g/\\u00b5L, respectively. These dispersions were used to test the response of QCMs using a drop-casting technique, depositing a volume of 1 \\u00b5L on their surface. Before each deposition, the dispersions were sonicated in an ultrasound bath for 3 min to avoid precipitation. In addition, to compare the influence of oscillation amplitude on the QCM response in the presence of a polymeric homogenous film versus microsphere dispersions, a PVP solution (PVP sol ) was prepared using EtOH as solvent (0.18 \\u00b5g/\\u00b5L).  Using an optical microscope (Leica DM2700 M) with an objective of 100\\u00d7/0.85 magnification and a field of view of 22 mm, it was possible to observe three depositions of borosilicate microspheres in the different dispersions (MS 10 , MS 2 , MS MIX ) on a quartz crystal slice, as shown in Figure 1. of EtOH (0.30 \\u00b5g/\\u00b5L), and MSMIX contained 2.1 mg of 10 \\u00b5m microspheres and 1.4 mg of 2 \\u00b5m microspheres in 10 mL of EtOH, resulting in concentrations of 0.42 \\u00b5g/\\u00b5L and 0.28 \\u00b5g/\\u00b5L, respectively.

Using an optical microscope (Leica DM2700 M) with an objective of 100x/0.85 magnification and a field of view of 22 mm, it was possible to observe three depositions of borosilicate microspheres in the different dispersions (MS10, MS2, MSMIX) on a quartz crystal slice, as shown in Figure 1. Three types of QCMs (10 MHz, 5 MHz, and 2.5 MHz of resonance frequency) were used, each with a different gold-coated electrode size (d = 5.9 mm, d = 6.3 mm, d = 5.0 mm, respectively), to evaluate the changes in responses due to variations in the fundamental frequency (as shown in Equation (4)). Moreover, we used a specific QCM (with a fixed fundamental frequency) to measure the response of each sample (MS10, MS2, MSMIX, PVPsol), using three levels of driving current, ILOW, IMED, and IH (to change the oscillation amplitude).   Measurement Setup  A block diagram of the measurement setup used during all of the experiments is represented in Figure 2A. A micropipette (PIPETMAN P2, variable volume 0.2-2.0 \\u00b5L, Serial N. KB29151) was used to deposit the sample of microsphere dispersion onto the QCM electrode by drop-casting. To simplify and reduce some errors, due to mechanical aspects, the micropipette was mechanically fixed on a robust stand during all depositions.  As previously described, we used three different QCMs to carry out all of the presented tests. To operate, a QCM needs to be connected to an oscillator circuit that sustains the oscillation conditions [31].

In Figure 2B, we have a photograph of the measurement setup where the highlighted QCM sensor (in particular, a 10 MHz crystal is in the photo) is connected to an oscillator circuit and to the main electronic unit, both enclosed in a single box (red one). A developed software controlled the measurement acquisitions and set all experimental parameters.

In this work, we used a suitable QCM oscillator circuit capable of sustaining the oscillation, and to set the crystal current (oscillator with amplitude control circuit, AC-OSC). Although in this paper we will not go into detail on how it works from an electronics point of view (as the circuit is under patent), the AC-OSC consists of two main parts, each working separately to sustain the oscillation (part a) and to control the amplitude of vibration by changing the oscillation current (part b). As already mentioned above, there is a lower limit current (ILimit) required for a stable oscillation, which depends on different QCM parameters (e.g., drive power level limit). In all of the experiments, we used three different setpoints of current for each QCM: low amplitude (Low), medium amplitude (Med), and high amplitude (High) correlated to the crystal current. In particular, about 0.9 mA, 1.8 mA, and 3.5 mA were used for the low, medium, and high amplitude, respectively (the crystal current is expressed by its root mean square value-RMS).  The main electronic unit (MEU) consisted of a microcontroller that managed all of the measurement phases, setting the driving current, acquiring the signal (fout) with a LOD of \\u00b1 3 Hz, and sending the measurement data to the PC unit for plotting and storage. Environmental information, such as temperature and relative humidity, were measured by a DHT22 sensor connected to \\u00b5C serial bus.   Results and Discussions  In the beginning, different depositions of the same volumes of PVPsol and MS10 on QCMs were performed to confirm the linear behavior of the Sauerbrey equation (Equation (1)).

To simplify the arrangement of the plot in all chronograms shown in this paper, we have not reported the dynamic behavior of the response |\\u2206f | during the dropcasting deposition. In fact, at the beginning of the deposition (t 0 ), the response fluctuated between 1 and 2 kHz, and returned stable (t 1 ) after tens of seconds. These phenomena could have been produced by the injection pressure and liquid phase of the samples. To highlight this time interval, we have introduced two oblique lines \\\"//\\\" in the plot, and only in the first have we indicated both t 0 and t 1 instants for each deposition. between 1 and 2 kHz, and returned stable (t1) after tens of seconds.

To highlight the results, only a single deposition example will be shown for each value of the set oscillation amplitude (Low, Med, High) in all of the following chronograms.   Homogeneous Film of PVP Deposition  Ten tests of a single deposition of PVPsol (1 \\u00b5L) were performed to investigate the effects of amplitude variations on the response of the QCMs. The results of all tests are summarized in the histograms in Figure 5. The same test procedure was executed for all three dispersions (MS2, MS10, and MSMIX). between 1 and 2 kHz, and returned stable (t1) after tens of seconds.

Homogeneous Film of PVP Deposition  Ten tests of a single deposition of PVPsol (1 \\u00b5L) were performed to investigate the effects of amplitude variations on the response of the QCMs. The results of all tests are summarized in the histograms in Figure 5.

Homogeneous Film of PVP Deposition  Ten tests of a single deposition of PVP sol (1 \\u00b5L) were performed to investigate the effects of amplitude variations on the response of the QCMs. The results of all tests are summarized in the histograms in Figure 5. The same test procedure was executed for all three dispersions (MS 2 , MS 10 , and MS MIX ). In Figure S1 of the Supplementary Materials, we report an example of the results obtained after PVPsol deposition on 10 MHz, 5 MHz, and 2.5 MHz crystals, carried out at low, medium, and high amplitude values. When the driving force varies (due to changes in amplitude), frequency shifts are significantly similar for each QCM. No differences in calculated mass (Equation (1)) were observed, despite varying resonance frequency and amplitude levels. The theoretical mass value (180 ng) is very close to the experimental masses obtained, according to PVPsol concentration. The results are summarized in Table  S1 of the Supplementary Materials. These data are in agreement with the thin film behavior reported in the literature [32][33][34][35]. Thin films are deposited as homogeneous layers onto the QCM electrode, and the frequency changes are related to an increase in mass, as predicted by the Sauerbrey equation (Equation (1)). In this experiment, the deposition on the electrode of the same volume of PVP leads to the formation of a homogeneous layer. The response does not vary appreciably by changing the f0 and the amplitude. Table 1 shows the average values of frequency calculated from all of the tests performed.    MS2 (Microspheres of 2 \\u00b5m) and MS10 (Microspheres of 10 \\u00b5m)  Examples of chronograms for MS2 dispersions are shown in Figure S2 in the Supplementary Materials for QCMs operating at 10 MHz (A), 5 MHz (B), and 2.5 MHz (C) frequencies, with low, medium, and high amplitudes. Even in this case, a behavior similar In Figure S1 of the Supplementary Materials, we report an example of the results obtained after PVP sol deposition on 10 MHz, 5 MHz, and 2.5 MHz crystals, carried out at low, medium, and high amplitude values. When the driving force varies (due to changes in amplitude), frequency shifts are significantly similar for each QCM.

The response does not vary appreciably by changing the f 0 and the amplitude. Table 1 shows the average values of frequency calculated from all of the tests performed.  to PVP sol can be observed at the amplitude variation. Frequency changes are related to very similar experimental masses when different QCMs are used, according to MS 2 concentration. These results are reported in Table S2. No notable changes in the frequency variation were observed by modulating the amplitude for each sensor. According to Equation (4), the particle diameter could be below the critical dimension for these three different levels (D p = 2 \\u00b5m < D crit ). We have evaluated the deposited mass for each QCM by Equation (1), taking into account the fundamental resonating frequency (10 MHz, 5 MHz, 2.5 MHz) [36] and the frequency shifts (|\\u2206f |) reported in Table S2. The calculated mass values were in the range of 256.6 ng to 329.5 ng, with tens of nanograms of deviation from a theoretical mass of 300 ng. Examples of chronograms for MS 10 dispersions are shown in Figure S3 in the Supplementary Materials for QCMs operating at 10 MHz (A), 5 MHz (B), and 2.5 MHz (C) frequencies with low, medium, and high amplitudes. The frequency shifts (|\\u2206f|) are reported in Table S3.  Ten tests were performed both for MS 2 and MS 10 , aiming to compare the results summarized in Figure 6. The histograms were constructed by considering the comparison between the depositions of MS 2 and MS 10 on each microbalance, achieved by modifying the amplitude. to PVPsol can be observed at the amplitude variation. Frequency changes are related to very similar experimental masses when different QCMs are used, according to MS2 concentration. These results are reported in Table S2. No notable changes in the frequency variation were observed by modulating the amplitude for each sensor. According to Equation (4), the particle diameter could be below the critical dimension for these three different levels (Dp = 2 \\u00b5m < Dcrit). We have evaluated the deposited mass for each QCM by Equation (1), taking into account the fundamental resonating frequency (10 MHz, 5 MHz, 2.5 MHz) [36] and the frequency shifts (|\\u0394f|) reported in Table S2. The calculated mass values were in the range of 256.6 ng to 329.5 ng, with tens of nanograms of deviation from a theoretical mass of 300 ng. Examples of chronograms for MS10 dispersions are shown in Figure S3 in the Supplementary Materials for QCMs operating at 10 MHz (A), 5 MHz (B), and 2.5 MHz (C) frequencies with low, medium, and high amplitudes. The frequency shifts (|\\u0394f|) are reported in Table S3. Ten tests were performed both for MS2 and MS10, aiming to compare the results summarized in Figure 6. The histograms were constructed by considering the comparison between the depositions of MS2 and MS10 on each microbalance, achieved by modifying the amplitude. In Figure 6A, the statistical dispersion of MS2 (blue) confirms that the average frequency variations are related to the concentration of the dispersion where Dp = 2 \\u00b5m < Dcrit, as expected. No response to any amplitudes is observed on the 10 MHz QCM (purple). As explained in Section 2.1, and as known from the literature [37][38][39], for lower coupling and larger dimensions, the particles are not able to follow the movement with the vibrations of the QCM. On the contrary, for strong coupling and smaller mass, the particles move with the vibrational surface of the QCM. Since the gold surface of the QCM and the borosilicate microspheres do not establish chemical bonds on the contact surface, the adhesion force depends mostly on the particle diameter and friction coefficient (Equation (2)). Experiments for this resonance frequency and the three modulated amplitude oscillations show a particular condition where particle diameter is larger than the critical dimension (Dp = 10 \\u00b5m > Dcrit). In Figure 6A, the statistical dispersion of MS 2 (blue) confirms that the average frequency variations are related to the concentration of the dispersion where D p = 2 \\u00b5m < D crit , as expected. No response to any amplitudes is observed on the 10 MHz QCM (purple). As explained in Section 2.1, and as known from the literature [37][38][39], for lower coupling and larger dimensions, the particles are not able to follow the movement with the vibrations of the QCM. On the contrary, for strong coupling and smaller mass, the particles move with the vibrational surface of the QCM. Since the gold surface of the QCM and the borosilicate microspheres do not establish chemical bonds on the contact surface, the adhesion force depends mostly on the particle diameter and friction coefficient (Equation (2)). Experiments for this resonance frequency and the three modulated amplitude oscillations show a particular condition where particle diameter is larger than the critical dimension (D p = 10 \\u00b5m > D crit ).  In Figure 6B, the average frequency variations (\\u2206 f ) are plotted as a function of the amplitudes on the 5 MHz QCM for ten tests carried out. Blue histograms represent the data found on MS 2 tests, where these average frequencies are once again in agreement with the concentration of the dispersion. There is a possibility that this resonance frequency is critical for MS 10 , where a strong dependence on the levels of amplitude has been observed (D p~1 0 \\u00b5m). In the same way, the purple histograms show a decrease in average frequency variations (\\u2206 f = 16 Hz) when the high level is used (fewer and smaller particles are detected), while the histograms show an increase (\\u2206 f = 53 Hz) when a lower level of amplitude is applied (more and bigger particles are measured), according to Equation (4). Figure 6C shows the results of \\u2206 f obtained at different levels of oscillation amplitude on the 2.5 MHz QCM. Blue histograms (MS 2 ) show no significant differences in the response when modulating the amplitude. All of the tests with MS 10 showed that the response depends on the amplitude value. In fact, for high and medium levels, no response was observed because D p > D crit , while for low levels D p < D crit , a response was obtained. The average frequency variation obtained (65 Hz) was identifiable to the deposited mass (calculated mass was 908.7 \\u00b1 74.6 ng). The average frequency variations obtained from the histograms are summarized in Table 2.    MS MIX (Microsphere Mix)  Examples of chronograms for MS MIX dispersions are shown in Figure S4 in the Supplementary Materials for QCMs operating at 10 MHz (A), 5 MHz (B), and 2.5 MHz (C) frequencies, with low, medium, and high amplitudes. The measured frequency shifts are reported in Table S4. In order to compare the results obtained for MS 10 and MS 2 , ten tests were performed for MS MIX . In Figure 7, we report the histograms of results on each microbalance, achieved by modifying the amplitude.  Figure 7A shows statistical data of tests on a 10 MHz QCM. Considering the responses previously obtained for MS2 and MS10 dispersions, frequency variations should be assigned to the 2 \\u00b5m microspheres because no response was observed for MS10 (Dp = 10 \\u00b5m > Dcrit). This outcome is consistent with the previous discussion (Section 3.2); the average frequency variations (Table 3) are related to the concentration of these particles in MSMIX. In the same way, Figure 7B reports the results of MSMIX on a 5 MHz QCM, where a critical dimensional condition for MS10 is observed (Dcrit around 10 \\u00b5m), and a strong dependence on the level of oscillation amplitude is shown. For this reason, when high and medium levels are used, the value of Dcrit decreases, and the average frequency variations are related to 2 \\u00b5m microspheres and smaller particles in the dimensional distribution of 10 \\u00b5m in MSMIX. For low levels, the value of Dcrit increases, and 2 \\u00b5m microspheres with larger particles of 10 \\u00b5m in MSMIX are detected.  Finally, Figure 7C shows histograms of the tests performed on the 2.5 MHz QCM. The average frequency variation observed should be attributed to the 2 \\u00b5m microspheres in MSMIX, because no response was observed for 10 \\u00b5m particles (Dp = 10 \\u00b5m > Dcrit) at high and medium levels. However, for low amplitude, the condition where Dp = 10 \\u00b5m < Dcrit was observed, and 2 \\u00b5m and 10 \\u00b5m microspheres in MSMIX were detected together. The average frequency variations obtained from the histograms are summarized in Table 3.   Figure 7A shows statistical data of tests on a 10 MHz QCM. Considering the responses previously obtained for MS 2 and MS 10 dispersions, frequency variations should be assigned to the 2 \\u00b5m microspheres because no response was observed for MS 10 (D p = 10 \\u00b5m > D crit ). This outcome is consistent with the previous discussion (Section 3.2); the average frequency variations (Table 3) are related to the concentration of these particles in MS MIX . In the same way, Figure 7B reports the results of MS MIX on a 5 MHz QCM, where a critical dimensional condition for MS 10 is observed (D crit around 10 \\u00b5m), and a strong dependence on the level of oscillation amplitude is shown. For this reason, when high and medium levels are used, the value of D crit decreases, and the average frequency variations are related to 2 \\u00b5m microspheres and smaller particles in the dimensional distribution of 10 \\u00b5m in MS MIX . For low levels, the value of D crit increases, and 2 \\u00b5m microspheres with larger particles of 10 \\u00b5m in MS MIX are detected.  Finally, Figure 7C shows histograms of the tests performed on the 2.5 MHz QCM. The average frequency variation observed should be attributed to the 2 \\u00b5m microspheres in MS MIX , because no response was observed for 10 \\u00b5m particles (D p = 10 \\u00b5m > D crit ) at high and medium levels. However, for low amplitude, the condition where D p = 10 \\u00b5m < D crit was observed, and 2 \\u00b5m and 10 \\u00b5m microspheres in MS MIX were detected together. The average frequency variations obtained from the histograms are summarized in Table 3.    Conclusions  In this paper, we study the effects of oscillation amplitude variations and fundamental frequency value on the QCM response, when particle matter of different sizes is deposited on the electrodes. Four different samples were prepared (PVP sol , MS 2 , MS 10 , and MS MIX ). From the literature, it is known that the detection of microspheres is influenced by resonant frequency (f 0 ) and crystal vibration amplitude (\\u03b2I). When D p < D crit , a particle adheres to the QCM surface and can be detected. On the contrary, when D p > D crit , a particle tends to slip from the surface. For the solution of PVP, no appreciable changes in responses with varying QCMs and amplitude levels were observed, according to homogenous film behavior. Similar performances to PVP sol were observed for MS 2 dispersion because the particle diameter is reasonably under the critical dimension (D p = 2 \\u00b5m < D crit ). For MS 10 , no response to any oscillation amplitude level was observed on the 10 MHz QCM. When the particle diameter overcomes the critical diameter (D p = 10 \\u00b5m > D crit ), the oscillation returns to the fundamental frequency after tens of seconds. A critical resonance frequency was assumed for the 5 MHz QCM, where D crit was around 10 \\u00b5m. The response was worsened when a high level of amplitude was applied, and improved when a low level was used. The response of the 2.5 MHz QCM to MS 10 depended strongly on the applied amplitude levels: high and medium intensities showed D p > D crit , while for the low level D p < D crit , and 10 \\u00b5m microspheres were detected. In the case of MS MIX , the responses on the 10 MHz QCM should be assigned to the 2 \\u00b5m microspheres (D p = 10 \\u00b5m > D crit ). More elaborate is the case on the 5 MHz QCM, where D crit was around 10 \\u00b5m and strong frequency variations were observed when different oscillation amplitude levels were applied. On the 2.5 MHz QCM for high and medium levels, the responses should be assigned to the 2 \\u00b5m microspheres because no response was observed for 10 \\u00b5m particles. For low levels, 2 \\u00b5m and 10 \\u00b5m microspheres were measured together due to the condition where D p = 10 \\u00b5m < D crit was observed. To validate the study carried out in this paper, it would be suitable to study intermediate conditions, considering resonance frequencies from 5 MHz to 2.5 MHz, where microspheres have a dimension between 2 \\u00b5m and 10 \\u00b5m for better estimation of the critical diameter value. This experiment's results have shown that by changing the oscillation amplitude and fundamental resonant frequency, it is possible to use a single QCM (e.g., 10 MHz) to measure only 2 \\u00b5m particles when both 2 and 10 \\u00b5m are collected on the QCM electrode. On the other hand, with a 2.5 MHz QCM, it is possible to measure both particles or only 2 \\u00b5m, if the amplitude oscillation is changed. These results could be used to develop a QCM array-based monitoring system to carry out particle dimensional analysis, using amplitude modulation.

The aim of the study was to compare the stunning of cattle with a captive bolt in two abattoirs. We monitored the slaughtering skills by measuring the deviation of the location of the stunning shot hole on the skull from the ideal point and further by measuring the angle of inclination of the stunning shot on the skull from the ideal perpendicular angle. We observed the impact of different slaughter skills on the quality of stunning of animals based on the occurrence of failure to achieve motor paralysis after a stun shot. The failure to collapse occurred significantly more frequently (P < 0.05) in abattoir A than in abattoir B. In both abattoirs there was a higher (P < 0.05) number of bulls failing to collapse than in females (cows and heifers). However, the effect of slaughter skills on the occurrence of signs associated with insufficient stunning was not found. The signs occurred in abattoir A and abattoir B to the same extent. In bulls, the number of animals with signs was higher (P < 0.05) than in females in both abattoirs. The results show that insufficient proficiency of skills in stunning cattle with a captive bolt leads to a higher number of animals failing to collapse after a stun shot. The effect of slaughter skills on the occurrence of signs in bulls and females was not proven; however, in bulls a higher incidence of signs was demonstrated than in females.Bull, cow, slaughter, stunning effectiveness, welfare ACTA VET.

Methods: We extracted publicly available data from official websites, summarized the containment measures implemented in China and India, and assessed their effectiveness. Results: China has responded to the COVID-19 outbreak with strict public health containment measures, including lockdown of Wuhan city, active case tracing, and large-scale testing, ultimately preventing a large increase in daily new cases and maintaining a low mortality rate per million population (as of May 5, 2021, daily new cases were 11 and mortality rate per million population was 3.37). India, although imposing a national lockdown to control the pandemic, has not implemented strict testing, tracking, and quarantine measures due to the overburdened healthcare system. Combined with massive lockdown, it has accelerated human mobility and exacerbated the epidemic, resulting in a rapid increase in daily new cases and a high mortality rate per million population (as of May 5, 2021, daily new cases were 412,431 and mortality rate per million population was 166.79). Conclusion: China and India implemented public health containment measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic based on their national situations. Meanwhile, daily new cases and mortality of COVID-19 also were affected by environmental and socioeconomic.

S. feltiae started reproduction at 10 o C, while all remaining species reproduced at 15 o C or higher temperatures.Maximum numbers of IJs were recovered from H. bacteriophora.Time taken for first emergence of IJs from the host was shortest at 25 o C i.e. 7-8 days in case of S. asiaticum and S. feltiae, while 11-13 days for H. bacteriophora and H. indica.Maximum emergence time was taken by S. feltiae at 10 o C. E ntomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) of both families Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae have already been effectively utilized to manage the numerous insect pests of agricultural importance (Aatif et al., 2015(Aatif et al., , 2016;;Kaya and Gaugler, 1993).These nematodes have shown best performances against soil inhabiting insect pests having cryptic behavior (Wright, 1992;Gaugler, 1988).Closely associated with reproduction of heterorhabditid and steinernematid nematodes are symbiotic bacteria of the genera Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus in the absence of which, the nematodes fail to kill insect or to reproduce (Ehlers, 1996).The bacteria live within the intestine of infective juvenile-stage (IJ) nematodes.When IJs of EPNs find host insect, they enter in the body of host through mouth, anus or spiracles (Poinar, 1979;Mason and Hominick, 1995).After getting inside the insect, EPNs penetrate into the haemolymph, and release bacteria.The bacteria proliferate and make favorable environment for nematode reproduction by providing nutrients and producing antimicrobial substances (Akhurst, 1982).Many abiotic factors affect EPNs but temperature is the most critical one.The infectivity, development and reproduction of EPNs are influenced by temperature (Grewal et al., 1994).Temperature was variable in both time and space.It was noted that the lower temperature caused the inactivity of the IJs (Rutherford et al., 1987).This is due to various enzymes and activity of various metabolic pathways (Fan and Hominick, 1991).  The range of temperature for the development and reproduction of heterorhabditis and steinernematids spp.and for their strains were different (Molyneux, 1983).The objective of the present study was to examine the reproductive potential of four species of EPNs at various temperatures.The study of S. asiaticum in this experiment would be novel.   Materials and methods  Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, H. indica, Steinernema feltiae and S. asiaticum were used for experimentation.Two species of EPNs (H.bacteriophora and S. feltiae) were taken from University of Readings, Readings, UK. S. asiaticum was obtained from NNRC, The larvae of G. mellonella were reared on cereal diet in Nematology Laboratory, Plant Pathology Department, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad (Wiesner, 1993).  EPNs were cultured on G. mellonella larvae.The freshly born EPNs were kept in shallow clear plastic containers with lids with suspension being no more than 1 cm in depth to ensure sufficient oxygen availability at 10\\u00b0C.All hatched juveniles were again cultured every 4 months.For EPNs, only those freshly produced in vitro (less than 2 weeks old) were used.  For the evaluation of reproductive potential of these four species of EPNs, larvae of G. mellonella were inoculated with EPNs species.Larvae were exposed to 300 IJs of each species in a 5cm petri dish.After inoculation petri plates containing inoculated larvae were incubated at various temperatures i.e., 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 o C using different incubators.Dead larvae were transferred to white traps (Woodering and Kaya, 1988;White, 1927) for the recovery of new progenies of IJs.After 7-10 days when new progenies of EPNs came out from dead insect cadaver, their counting was carried out under stereomicroscope (Olympus 5240).Data were recorded on the basis of EPNs reproductive potential inside host.The experiment was conducted under CRD design and there were three replications for each treatment.  All data collected was subjected to statistical analysis by analysis of variance and regression analysis using statistical package Genstat 6.0 for Windows (VSN International Ltd, UK).Graphs were prepared using the Excel for Windows 2007.   Results  ANOVA for establishment of EPNs at various temperature ranges showed that effect of treatments and species was significant (p> 0.05).Interaction of treatments and species was also significant (Table I).The ratio of IJs which were successfully established inside G. mellonella was temperature dependent and differed among species.Our results showed that IJs of any species of EPN could not establish itself inside G. mellonella larvae at 5 o C, while at 10 o C only S. feltiae showed its establishment.The highest percentage of establishment was achieved with S. feltiae at 15 o C, H. indica at 25 o C and with S. asiaticum at 25 o C (Table I).  Time taken for the first emergence of IJs from host was shortest at 25 o C i.e. 7-8 days in the case of S. asiaticum and S. feltiae, while 11-13 days were spent for H. bacteriophora and H. indica.Maximum time taken for emergence of IJs at 10 o C in S. feltiae was 70 days (Table II).There was an inverse relationship between time and temperature for first emergence of IJs.The reproduction rate of H. bacteriophora was significantly higher than all three EPNs species.It was followed by H. indica and S. feltiae while the reproduction rate of S. asiaticum was the lowest among all the species evaluated.There was no reproduction of any species at 5 o C, while at 10 o C only S. feltiae could reproduce.All other species like H. bacteriophora, H. indica and S. asiaticum started reproduction at 15 o C. The rate of reproduction of S. feltiae was lower at higher temperature (25 o C), while the reproductive potential of all other species showed increasing trends with increase of temperature (Fig. 1).   Discussion  On the basis of the recent work, it is suggested that the differences among four species regarding their establishment and reproductive rates are either due to their mutualistic bacteria or temperature or the combined effect of both of them, because in the absence of symbiotic bacteria, the nematodes fail to kill insect or to reproduce (Ehlers, 1996).The conserved nature of nematode thermal niche breadth would support the hypothesis that temperature activity ranges of different species represent the climatic conditions of their original locality.Tolerance to warm temperatures by H. indica and S. asiaticum suggest tropical origins.Our results collaborate the findings of Grewal et al. (1994) who reported S. scapterisci, S. riobravis and Steinernema sp. are warm adopted species whereas S. scapterisci was stored better at 10 and 25 o C than at 5 o C. In contrast, S. feltiae is a species of temperate origin and can infect insects between 8-30 o C and reproduce between 10-25 o C. Thermal adjustment of EPNs can be supported through effective survival strategies.S. carpocapsae is not active at lower temperature (Molyneux, 1986), cannot reproduce below 15 o C, but still is found in cooler areas.Grewal et al. (1994) reported that S. carpocapsae can penetrate the insect at 10 o C, rest within living host for prolonged times and when temperature increases it restarts its normal growth.Therefore, it may be capable of overwintering in the hosts.Variations among temperature adaptation may result in host specialization among EPNs.The species adjusted to lower temperature reproduction like S. feltiae would be effective insect parasites which are active in winter.Species adjusted to warmer temperature reproduction like H. indica and S. asiaticum would kill insects which are active during summer.The recent study revealing the optimum temperature for reproduction will be helpful in mass production of EPNs and their use in IPM programs in Pakistan.    ://dx.doi.org/10.17582/journal.pjz/2017.49.1.sc12Karachi and H. indica was obtained from Nematology Laboratory, Plant Pathology Department, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad.

Although various approaches have been adopted for the eradication of malaria, still it remains a major health concern, particularly where it acquires an endemic dimension. Thus, malaria has drawn the attention of many researchers, especially in developing countries. This is due to the death of the children, pregnant women, and HIV-infected patients due to malaria [1]. According to the WHO, the worldwide total number of 219 million cases of malaria were reported in 2017 and out of the reported cases, 435,000 clinical death occurred. Although the disease is reported worldwide, yet most affected areas are tropical and subtropical regions. The causative organism of malaria is a protozoan pathogen of Plasmodium species. Malaria in humans is caused by four species of Plasmodium, e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale. However, 5th species of Plasmodium is also reported, which normally infects animals; it is P. knowlesi. Malaria is transmitted by Plasmodium-infected female anopheles bites. Infected female anopheles injects sporozoite into the blood during its blood meal. Sporozoites travel through the vasculature from the skin and infect liver [2].  The possibility of complete elimination and protection against malaria needs some effective antimalarial vaccine to be developed against the pre-erythrocytic stage of the cycle that may offer effective protection. The emergence of resistance against drugs and evasion of immune could lead to excessively high morbidity and mortality. It is not only drug resistance that is developed by the parasite but also pathogen borne toxicity; thus, they are a major concern. Other factors including patient compliance, misdiagnosis, incorrect dosing, poor drug quality, and poor living conditions taken together are responsible for the failure of malaria treatment. Therefore, this seems to be an imperative that delivery systems based on the current cutting edge technologies should be developed capable of circumventing the possibilities of drug resistance development. Because of various drawbacks of present malaria treatment as highlighted above, it is desirable that an attempt should be made to replace conventional monotherapy with combination therapy which reportedly reduces the occurrence of drug resistance. However, combination therapy too could not assure complete eradication of malaria infection [3]. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) have become a primary clinical choice which results in rapid clearance of parasite. The combination therapy, however, appears to be costly and also suffers some added side effects. It is also dependent on the socioeconomic condition, drug-drug interaction, drug-food interactions, lacking the drug quality distributed in the malarious region, and self-medication which add to the existing challenges. Nevertheless, gene sequencing of P. falciparum and advancement in malaria genetics present several novel molecular targets for effective drug designing and also for targeted drug delivery [4]. Currently, various pharmaceutical companies and research agencies are involved in the drug discovery and development process of antimalarial therapy, which could be accomplished with the advancements of novel drugs with better pharmacokinetic profile and costeffectiveness and also suitable for the children and pregnant women [3]. Figure 1 shows the schematic representation of drawbacks of current antimalarial drug therapy.   Strategies for drug targeting  Drugs enter within the RBCs cell through diffusion across the cell membrane, which is composed of amphipathic lipids such as phospholipids and cholesterol organized in a bilayer. The erythrocytic membrane also contains proteins, which serve as receptors and transporters. Hence, antimalarial drugs can reach their target either by carrier-mediated transportation or diffusion through lipid membrane. Carrier-mediated transportation is referred to as facilitated diffusion in case energy is not utilized or active transport if energy is consumed in the process. Carrier-mediated transportation is saturable, subjected to inhibition and stereospecific. Uncharged chemicals exhibit lipid-based diffusion; however, charged molecules are not able to cross the lipid membrane [5].  Plasmodium parasite resides within the RBCs thus escapes the host immune system. Therefore, to target the Plasmodium, the drug must cross various membranous barriers i.e. the RBCs membrane, parasitophorous vacuolar membrane, the plasma membrane of parasite, and depending on the targeting site i.e. food vacuolar membrane or apicoplast membrane. To achieve high parasite clearance rate, optimum plasma drug concentration should be attained at target, i.e., infected RBCs. Figure 2 represents the membranous systems required to be surpassed by the nanocarrier to reach the target site.  The drug targeting aims to achieve high drug concentration at the target site i.e. RBCs or liver cells to prevent the systemic side effects of the drug, caused by the non-specific biodistribution of drugs and able to enhance the drug efficacy. Nanocarriers are below < 1000 nm in size. They are essentially colloidal nanoparticles characterized by high surface area to volume ratio [6]. Nanocarriers should be designed appreciating some important parameters including plasma concentration which is directly proportional to the toxic effects of the drugs and efficacy that in turn directly correlates with the area under the curve (AUC). Thus, to alter the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug and achieve high drug concentration at the target site, these parameters become of paramount significance. PEGylated nanocarriers reportedly enhance the drug efficacy, reduce the dose of the drug, reduce the dosage frequency, and improve the AUC of the drug. The contact period or circulation time of nanocarrier is of importance in the treatment of malaria. Long circulation time enhances the interaction between RBCs and nanocarriers, ultimately leading to iRBCs specific targeting and improved efficacy [7]. The exact mechanism by which nanocarrier contained antimalarials are delivered to the infected RBCs is not clear. There are two proposed mechanisms, referred to as the traditional sequence pathway and a parallel pathway. Infected RBCs become leakier as compared with the normal RBC to fulfill their nutritional requirements from the extra RBC environment (fluid). Nanocarrier which is of the size below < 80 nm diameter may have direct access to the infected RBCs due to their leakiness. Thus, nanocarriers reach within the infected RBCs along with the contents. Selectivity could also be achieved by exploring this proposed mechanism because normal RBCs do not have a leaky membrane and hence a nanocarrier may enter directly into the infected RBCs only. Another proposed mechanism is membrane fusion, i.e., a drug bearing formulation fuses with iRBC membrane. There is a basic dissimilarity between these two pathways about the role of the cytosol of RBC. In the first proposed mechanism, nanocarrier is noticed to bypass the cytosol of RBC; in contrast, drug molecule passes through the cytosol in case of the second mechanism. New permeation pathways (NPP) are responsible for enhanced permeability of iRBCs to a small solute. Tubovesicular membrane (TVM) arises from the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane that extends up to RBC membrane [8] (Fig. 3). TVM is near NPP, so nanocarrier having a size below 80 nm may sink directly into parasite while escaping the cytosol of RBCs. The secondary mechanism involves membrane fusion and active targeting to the iRBCs. In this mechanism, the drug enters the parasite via cytosol of the iRBC [9].  There are two strategies for targeting infected RBCs viz. passive targeting and active targeting. Passive drug targeting is achieved by the use of conventional nanocarriers, i.e., polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, or long-circulating nanocarriers (PEGylated). Active drug targeting on the other hand is achieved by the surface activation of the nanocarriers by using specific ligands to the infected RBCs associated receptors such as ligands include carbohydrate, peptide, or antibodies and proteins [10]. Figure 4 diagrammatically represents the phenomenon of active and passive targeting.  3 Diagrammatically presentation of the proposed mechanism for drug uptake. (a) Parallel pathway in which nanocarrier having size range of below 80 nm reaches directly to the parasite and escaping host cell cytoplam. This is due to the \\\"leakiness\\\" of the infected RBC membrane. New permeation pathways (NPP) arises on the host cell membrane (HCM), which is in close pruximity eith tubulovesicular network (TVN). TVN arises in the cytoplasm of RBC to access the nutrients from the extracellular medium. (b) Traditional sequence pathway: nanocarrier interacts with the receptor expressed on the iRBC membrane and then sequence crosses the host cell membrane (HCM), paracitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM), and then parasite plasma membrane (PPM) to reach its target side    Passive drug targeting  Nanocarrier-based passive targeting leads to accumulation of carrier drug in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) predominant organ. Such carriers are not specifically designed due to their defined size, charge, shape, and nature of material intercepted and captured by phagocytic cells of RES prominent organs and also circulatory phagocytic cells. The phenomenon has a unique spin-off in case of carcinoma where the leaky neovasculature exists. Due to leakiness of tumorassociated vessels, a nanocarrier retained at tumor site and thus yielding comparatively better therapeutic effects due to target accumulation of carrier and hence the drug. The permeation associated phenomenon may also operate in case of iRBCs which are leaky to meet out the requirements of nutrients specifically by needed parasite. However, no systematic studies are available in the literature on iRBCs membraneassociated that are pores, their size and their role in nutrients capture and supply. Nevertheless, the altered permeability phenomenon of iRBCs is well defined and determined that may subserve as a biomodule for passive drug targeting to such cellular destination [7].  Surface properties at large determine the internalization of the nanocarriers in the cells together with their circulation time in blood. Alteration of the surface properties of nanocarriers such as PEGylation prevents its opsonization and further clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) [11]. PEGylation is the phenomenon where nanocarriers are modified with the covalent conjugation with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Moreover, circulation time also increases by an increase in the molecular weight of the PEG chain. PEGylation is used to overcome various drawbacks associated with the biopharmaceutical parameters of a drug/carrier such as pharmacokinetic properties, drug solubility, immunogenicity, and low retention time. It enhances the retention time of the nanocarrier in the blood which is a prerequisite in the case of malaria [12]. Raza et al. prepared the long circulatory liposomal formulation of maduramicin, which exhibited excellent growth inhibition of blood-stage P. falciparum parasite in culture and cures murine model of experimental malaria. They reported that maduramicin in the PEGylated liposomal formulation shows enhanced antiplasmodial activity in vitro compared with the plain maduramicin. It is active against a chloroquine-resistant murine model of malaria and devoid of toxic effects and could prevent the progression of the disease. It also displayed an extended plasma clearance rate, which enhances and favors drug accumulation particularly in infected RBCs [13]. Table 1 summarizes some of the antimalarial formulations which are based on passive drug targeting mechanism.   Active drug targeting  Nanocarriers are designed to enhance the efficacy of treatment wherein drug targeting is of particular importance. Active (1) Passive drug targeting achieved by conventional nanicarriers such as liposome, polymeric nanoparticles, and long-circulating nanocarriers (PEGylated), (2) active drug targeting which is achieved by the nanocarriers modified with the ligands suvh as carbohydrate, protein, peptide, or antibodies drug targeting can restrict the non-specific distribution of drugs to the other organs and thus decreases the side effects. Currently, carrier-based drug targeting employing nanoparticles, liposomes, NLCs, nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, and cyclodextrin has been studied and exploited for malaria treatment. Apart from these specific ligands such as carbohydrates, antibodies, peptides, or protein have been conjugated with nanocarriers, which specifically present the delivery system to the target site. Thus, active drug targeting can maximize the therapeutic effects and seemingly emerge as a promising and attractive strategy [20].  Active targeting can be achieved by the use of carbohydrate as a ligand. An intracellular pathogen can impart various modifications in the host cell to ensure their development and survival. Blood stage of the Plasmodium parasite relies on glycolysis, as the main source of ATP production. Thus, glucose is a major need of the Plasmodium parasite and to fulfill its need hexose transporters 1 (PfHT1) are expressed on the surface of the iRBCs. PfHT1 and the mammalian glucose transporter (GLUT-1) are overexpressed on the infected erythrocyte, for increased uptake of glucose [21]. Shafi et al. use carbohydrates as a ligand to specifically target the infected RBCs. Dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) exhibits competitive behavior with glucose for GLUT-1 binding. They prepared chloroquine-loaded chitosan nanoparticle with 170-200 nm in size with 50-57% entrapment efficiency. CSN is superior in terms of uptake and preferential targeting to the infected RBCs as compared with normal RBC. Parasite inhibition was achieved at 1 nM concentration, while free drug exhibited a comparative activity at 100 nM. It is convincing that specific targeting can reduce the dose and overcome the efflux-based drug resistance [22]. Table 2 summarizes some of the antimalarial formulations which are based on active drug targeting mechanism.   Nanotechnology in the treatment of malaria  Targeted drug delivery systems can deliver the antimalarial drug selectively to the specific target, i.e., iRBCs. This is achieved by both active and passive targeting. As we discussed earlier, nanotechnology addresses various drawbacks including low oral bioavailability, short half-life, poor water solubility, the emergence of drug resistance, and nonspecific drug targeting. Nanosized carriers have drawn the attention of many researchers for their ability to minimize the side effects associated with conventional drug therapy. The goal of the nanocarriers is to protect the drug or vaccine against extracellular degradation and enhance target specific delivery thus decreasing the frequency of administration with improved efficacy and dosage regimen [30]. 6. Artesunate Nanocapsule Artesunate-heparin conjugated nanocapsules (ART-HEP-NCPs) inhibited in vitro P. falciparum 3D7 and an extended circulation in blood. [19] The advantages of nanocarriers as drug delivery systems (a) Exhibit specific targeting leading to higher intracellular accumulation of drug(s). (e) The frequency of administration and duration of the treatment can be reduced. (f) Particle aggregation or blockage of the fine blood capillaries does not occur and hence can be administered by the intravenous route. (g) Nowadays, researchers from various multi-and interdisciplinary areas such as pharmacochemistry, toxicology, and pharmacology are involved in the development of the targeted drug delivery, which is based on the extensive research experience in the various fields, thus promising outcomes are expected [30].  [29] The nanotechnology can be a boon in the treatment of malaria. The present review discusses various nanocarriers commonly used for targeted drug delivery to infected RBCs.   Lipid-based drug delivery carriers  Lipid is a preferred choice as a drug vehicle due to its physiological compatibility. Lipid carriers include various ingredients like cholesterol, triglyceride, phospholipid, and fatty acid. Furthermore, lipid carriers offer various advantages over polymeric carriers such as the sustained release of the hydrophobic drugs, cost-effective, fewer chances of erosion of matrix, and most importantly the biocompatibility. The drug delivery systems that utilize various lipid carriers are liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), and self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) [31].   Liposome as a nanocarrier  Liposomes are the spherical vesicles made up of phospholipids assembled in the bilayers. Liposomes can be used for the encapsulation of single or more drugs. Due to their bilayer structure, hydrophobic drugs can be incorporated in the lipid bilayers while hydrophilic drugs in or within the aqueous core [32]. Plain liposome or PEGylated liposome is extensively studied as a nanocarrier for the treatment of malaria. Liposomes are superior to nanoparticles in regard to the therapeutic index of the antimalarial drugs. They could enhance the circulation time and decrease the intrinsic toxicity and immunogenicity. PEGylation as such offers an additional advantage of enhancing the circulation time of liposomes. Thus, liposomes attracted immense attention of researchers for their potential in the treatment of malaria.  Ismail and coworkers encapsulated artesunate and its derivative into the liposomes and administered by i.v. route. They exhibited excellent in vivo results. The dimerization and self-assembly strategies were used to prepare novel amphiphilic dimeric artesunate phospholipid (Di-ART-GPC) conjugate-based liposomes. This unique approach demonstrated appreciably high drug loading and better pharmacokinetic properties. The pharmacokinetic studies reveal that liposomes and conjugate have a greater retention time in the blood. Di-ART-GPC liposomes and conjugate exhibit IC50 value of 0.39 nM and 1.90 nM respectively and better in vitro antiplasmodial activities without causing hemolysis. Free ART-and conventional ART-loaded liposomes show IC50 value of 5.17 nM and 3.13 nM respectively. The liposomes could increase the extent of parasite eradication in P. berghei-infected mice in vivo and delayed recrudescence and enhanced survival as compared with the free artesunate [33].  Liposomes could also deliver both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs simultaneously. In combination therapy, two different drugs with different modes of action can be administered simultaneously that reduce the occurrence of drug resistance and enhance the efficacy of treatment regimen. Biosca et al. have reported a immunoliposome-based nanocarrier that incorporates both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. For targeting Plasmodium-infected RBCs, the gametocytes antibodies against glycophorin A were used. Gametocyte blocking drugs such as pyronaridine and atovaquone were co-encapsulated in the glycophorin Atargeted immunoliposomes. It exhibited significantly higher activity as compared with the free drug, in vitro resulting in 50% inhibition of the growth of the parasite [25].  Antimalarial activity of monensin was reported by the Rajendran et al. They prepared liposomes using soyaphosphatidyl choline cholesterol containing either stearylamine or phosphatidic acid and different mole fractions of distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine-methoxy-PEG 2000. In vitro and in vivo activity of the developed formulation was studied on Plasmodium falciparum cultures and murine models of Plasmodium berghei respectively. It was found to be superior to free monensin when compared. The IC50 values of 0.74 nM and 0.39 nM for the SA liposome and SPC:Chol-liposome with 5 mol% DSPE-mPEG 2000 respectively were recorded, which was lower than the free monensin (3.17 nM), and it did not show hemolysis; thus antiplasmodial activity of SA liposome and SPC:Chol-liposome with 5 mol% DSPE-mPEG 2000 was greater than free monensin formulation. Long circulatory liposomes of the monensin with 5 mol% DSPE-mPEG 2000 in combination with free artemisinin show greater parasite clearance, recrudescence inhibition, and enhanced survival [18].  Apart from the treatment, the liposomal formulation can also be used in the diagnosis of cerebral malaria (CM). CM is a severe form of malaria which is caused by the P. falciparum. Misdiagnosis or late diagnosis often delays the treatment that leads to mortality. Thus, to overcome these issues, Portnoy et al. have prepared liposomes containing an FDA approved fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG) for the diagnosis of CM in a murine model. Emission intensities of the liposomal formulation were high as compared with the free ICG. ICG bearing liposomes showed higher emission in the brain of the infected mice as compared with the control mice and drug-treated mice. Histopathological analysis revealed that accumulation of formulation in the vasculature of the brain is due to extensive uptake of liposomes by the activated macrophages. Thus, it can be a valuable diagnostic tool and biomarker for early detection of CM [34].  Parnham et al. reported screening of the liposomes for toxicity. Potential toxicity of the liposomes can be due to the metabolism of liposomal constituents. Various in vitro and in vivo tests such as thrombosis, hemolysis, cytotoxicity to L1210 mouse leukemia cells, platelet aggregation, phagocytic index, pyrogenicity, acute parenteral toxicity, and local tolerance have been carried out to rule out potential toxicity of liposomes. Hypersensitivity, however, still remains a possible toxicological risk with drugs that are administered repeatedly. However, in this context, liposomes offer various advantages over other carriers. Nevertheless, for research purposes, simple toxicity tests are sufficient; unfortunately, these simple toxicity tests are not sufficient at the advanced stages of malaria. Extensive testing of the liposomes reveals that it is safe for pharmaceutical use [35].  Liposomes are a well-established drug delivery system that could be tailored with various ranges, in terms of morphology and surface charge. They can be used for the encapsulation of hydrophilic/hydrophobic drugs. Liposomes can be formulated as a long circulatory carrier that has already exhibited better therapeutic outcomes. Thus, they hold great potential and promise to be an efficacious option adaptable for clinical application. Moreover, they should also be studied for the intrinsic toxicology in a systematic manner.  On the basis of studies as above, it can be appreciated that products based on phospholipids are a relatively safe therapeutic option and also they provide biochemically modulated targeting, wherein the lipid counterpart is an essential/ nutritional and biochemical need of parasite. To thrive upon within infected RBCs, it is a prerequisite to uptake circulatory lipids drug conjugate, which leads to infected RBCs specific drug targeting. Product as well as a carrier i.e. liposomes are seemingly devoid of toxicological implications, and represent for scientifically well-founded strategies. Nevertheless, after systematic toxicological studies, it may become the clinical reality with better clinical results of the coming future.   Nanostructured lipid carrier as a nanocarrier  As an alternative to the liposomes, emulsions, polymeric nanoparticles, and lipid nanocarriers have been explored as a drug delivery system. These are the 2nd generation lipid carriers, developed and studied to circumvent the drawbacks associated with solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). NLCs are promising carriers that can incorporate hydrophobic drugs and also they are biocompatible. The NLCs have superior characteristics as compared with other lipid formulations. NLCs are composed of a mixture of lipids as liquid and solid phases that form a liquid lipid matrix, where the drug is accommodated; and hence superior characters in terms of drug stability and release characterstics are achieved [35].  Lipids play a classical role in the life cycle of Plasmodium. Lipid metabolism is not significant in the normal RBCs while its demand is increased significantly in the case of iRBCs. In order to fulfill this demand, the uptake of the lipid occurs from the host. The normal RBCs and iRBCs can be distinguished based on their lipid requirement. Based on this principle, Jain et al. prepared a glyceryl-dilaurate nano lipid carriers (GDL-NLCs) for the delivery of antimalarials and tested them in a murine malaria model. Infected RBCs were selectively targeted and impaired by the GDL-NLCs. GDL was used as a targeting ligand GDL-NLCs was primarily accumulated within the mitochondria of the Plasmodium. This leads to the mitochondrial membrane polarization, Ca 2+ ion accumulation, ROS release, and stage-specific lysis of the infected RBCs. GDL-NLCs also promoted the clearance of infected RBCs by the macrophages. It also disrupts the Plasmodium TVN, which is essential for the import of nutrients from the host. Optical trap studies demonstrated that GDL-NLCs restore the flexibility of the infected RBCs. The NLCs can entrap hydrophobic drugs and selectively target them to the iRBCs and hence may be a potent drug delivery carrier for the treatment of malaria [28].  Another study by Baruah et al. reports chloroquine-loaded NLCs. Chloroquine is the most widely used antimalarial for its various properties such as efficiency, stability, safety, and low cost. However, the emergence of resistance against chloroquine limits its uses. The CQ-NLCs could increase antimalarial efficacy with rapid parasitic clearance. Thus, loading of the antimalarials in the NLCs overcomes the drawbacks associated with the available conventional drugs [36].  Artemether-lumefantrine (ARM-LFN) is a WHOapproved fixed-dose combination which suffers oral bioavailability and solubility issues. The NLCs were prepared by Prabhu et al. to overcome these issues. WHO recommends the adult therapeutic dose of 80 mg for ARM and 480 mg for LFN (4 tablets) two times in a day. ARM-LFN NLCs were administered at the 1/5 of the conventional therapeutic dose (16 mg ARM and 96 mg LFN), which exhibited total parasite clearance and complete survival of P. berghei-infected mice. NLCs exhibited an increased efficacy at 1/10 daily dose of ARM-LFN. The 1/10 reduced the daily dose incorporated in two soft gelatin capsules. The capsule exhibits better stability at room temperature for a year. Thus, NLCs due to its biocompatible nature would be promising strategies for malaria therapy [37]. Table 3 summarizes some of the nanostructured lipid carrier-based antimalarial formulations.  The strategies and related literature reveal that NLCs are biocompatible and appropriate system for poorly watersoluble drugs. They have intrinsic targetability towards the cell i.e. iRBCs owing to their lipoidal nature, which satisfies the biochemical need of parasite. Thus, they may result in efficacious drug delivery system specifically suited to drugs which because of their solubility cannot be formulated in parenteral form or cleared fast by the circulation thus limited for their use. Nevertheless, such a system also needs elaborated studies relating to toxicology.   Solid lipid nanoparticles as a nanocarrier  SLNs were developed as an alternative to lipid-based nanocarriers such as liposomes, emulsions, micelles, and polymeric nanoparticles. Various biocompatible lipids used in the preparation of SLNs include precirol, cetyl alcohol, compritol, glyceryl monostearate, cetyl palmitate, stearic acid, tristearin, and trimyristin. SLNs can be synthesized without using toxic organic solvents. Thus, SLNs meet the requirement of the optimum drug delivery system for the incorporation of the lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs [41].  Heparin-functionalized nanocarriers can selectively target the iRBCs. Incorporation of the heparin enhances the stealth character and efficiently allows to bypass the reticuloendothelial system vis-to-vis an enhanced targeting of drugs with increased uptake and accumulation in the iRBCs. Heparin also synergizes the action of antimalarial drugs due to its intrinsic antimalarial activity. Chloroquine-loaded heparin-surfaced functionalized SLNs were prepared by the Muga et al. and evaluated in vitro against chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains. IC50 value of CQ-SLN and CQ-Hep-SLN was found to be 4.72 \\u00b1 0.14 ng/ mL and 2.41 \\u00b1 0.27 ng/mL respectively. These findings suggest that SLNs have superior in vitro activity than chloroquine when tested on chloroquine-sensitive parasite [29].  Muller et al. reported in vitro cytotoxicity studies of the SLNs as a function of lipid matrix and surfactant. For the lipid matrix Dynasan 114 and compritol ATO 888 concentration is used and tween 80, poloxamers, sodium dodecyl sulphate and soya lecithin is used as a surfactant. Cytotoxicity studies were carried out by measuring the viability of HL60 cells and human granulocytes. Chemiluminescence measurements were carried out to quantify the particle internalization. The results revealed that viability does not get affected by the nature of lipid. Following binding to the SLNs surface, the cytotoxic effect of surfactants such as poloxamer tends to decrease significantly. Thus, SLNs exhibited relatively low cytotoxicity as compared with other nanoparticles, i.e., polylactic/ glycolic acid and polyalkylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles. Thus, SLNs demonstrated great potential as a drug carrier system for the intravenous administration [42].  SLNs can be explored for oral as well as parental administration; they may improve the solubility of poorly aqueous soluble drug and hence their bioavailability. Furthermore, they can be fabricated for active drug targeting in case they are designed for target-oriented drug delivery. The issue related to drug payload, plasma protein interaction, targetability, nonspecific accumulation in organs, circulatory half-life, dose computation, patient compliance, and toxicological implications is required to be studied.  Self-microemulsifying drug delivery system as a nanocarrier Self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) is a stable mixture of active medicaments, surfactants, co-surfactant, and oil. Although SMEDDS are the SEDDS, which are arranged in the form of fine oil globules in water (o/w) and droplets with a diameter smaller than 50 nm on mild agitation in the GI tract are produced. Poorly water-soluble drugs can be effectively delivered and also the system may prevent drug degradation in the GIT. SMEDDS provides the larger surface area for the diffusion of the drug [43]. Primaquine is a gametocytocidal which is used to prevent transmission of malaria by preventing the spread of malaria. Primaquine, however, has some drawbacks like short halflife (5.6 h), first-pass metabolism, and dose-dependent side effects such as leukocytosis, methanoglobenmia, leukocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia in G6PD-deficient patients. Thus, frequent administration of primaquine (PQ) is needed and sometimes it shows some severe adverse effects. To overcome these issues, PQ was encapsulated in the SMEDDS to achieve higher therapeutic efficacy. Chudiwal and coworkers delivered the primaquine (PQ) as a SMEDDS to enhance liver uptake and increase efficacy against the liver stages of P. vivax. Pharmacodynamic efficacy was evaluated by applying Peter 's Four Day Suppressive Test in a murine model. SMEDDS show higher antimalarial efficacy than marketed formulations. Results of biodistribution studies suggest that SMEDDS are specifically targeted to the liver [44]. Thus, it is a suitable carrier for liver-stage malaria.  Another study was carried out by Bhandari et al. to enhance the oral bioavailability of the artemether and lumefantrine. SMEDDS could increase aqueous solubility, which led to enhanced absorption. Optimized formulation was adsorbed on the Neusilin US2\\u00ae using a spray drying technique for conversion into solid SMEDDS. Ninety percent of the artemether and lumefantrine were released in 15 min in the dissolution media. Globule size of the SMEDDS was 67.74 nm. The formulation released the contents at a faster rate in vivo as compared with the marketed tablets [45].  Curcumin and artemisinin show poor aqueous solubility, which leads to poor oral bioavailability. SMEDDS significantly improve the solubility of curcumin (4.4 mg/3 mL) and artemisinin (73.4 mg/3 mL). The optimized formulation consisted of Tween 80, PEG 400, and oleic acid. The dissolution study reveals that curcumin and artemisinin dissolved up to 63.81% and 54.91% respectively in 1.2 pH within 1.5 h. These studies demonstrated that SMEDDS has potential as an alternative to the conventional formulation of curcumin and artemisinin [46]. SMEDDS could be administered orally for lymphatic transportation and absorption. The materials used in their preparation are at large FDA approved. Thus, after, appropriate toxicological studies such a system(s) could be explored for their clinical application. Table 4 summarizes some of the self-emulsifying drug delivery system(s) (SEDDS)-based antimalarial formulations.   Polymer-based nanocarriers  Polymer-based nanocarriers offer several advantages such as enhanced bioavailability, good biocompatibility, increased drug solubility, and reduced toxicity. Various polymer-based nanocarriers are polymeric nanoparticle, dendrimers, hydrogels, etc. [1].  Drug resistance is the major concern in the case of malaria; the nanotechnological attempts have been made to overcome chloroquine resistance. Dextran is a biopolymer which is approved by the US-FDA for i.v. administration. iRBCs allow access to the macromolecules as nutrients via the parasitophorous duct. Kashyap et al. prepared chloroquine dextrin nanoparticles (CHQ-DEX-NPs) by the solvent diffusion method, which are directly taken up by the iRBCs through parasitophorous duct arriving at a therapeutic concentration at the target side. IC50 value of the CHQ-DEX-NPs in sensitive 3D7 and resistant RKL9 P. falciparum strain was 0.031 \\u03bcg/mL and 0.13 \\u03bcg/mL, which is significantly less than 0.059 \\u03bcg/mL and 0.36 \\u03bcg/mL of free drug [51].  Helmut Ringsdorf was first to introduce a polymer-based delivery system. Low molecular weight drug or hydrophobic bioactive agents were covalently linked with a hydrophilic polymeric carrier. Currently, polymer-drug conjugates are being used as drug delivery systems. The targeting moiety and solubilizing agents are also incorporated into the polymerdrug carriers, which further enhance the therapeutic efficacy of the bioactive. Various drawbacks associated with the current antimalarial drugs include drug toxicity, multiple drug resistance, low bioavailability, poor water solubility, and biodegradability. A polymer-drug conjugate increases bioavailability and biodegradability. The polymer-based carriers could improve the water solubility of active medicament and could effectively deliver the bioactive(s) at the target site(s). Pharmacodynamics and pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of drugs thus got improved when administered as polymer-drug conjugate [52].  Alven et al. have combined antibiotics with antimalarials applying polymer-drug conjugation, which provided synergistic effects. They have conjugated and incorporated antibiotics and antimalarials together onto a polyaspartamide molecule. The conjugate formation was confirmed by FTIR, 1HNMR, SEM, and XRD pattern. The conjugate exhibited amorphous nature and drug was found to be associated with the polymer(s) in chemically conjugated form. The antimalarial activity against the asexual phase of Plasmodium was recorded with 35.6-99.9 of percentage inhibition when tested in varied concentrations, i.e., 1 to 5 \\u03bcM. The antimalarial activity of the polymer-drug conjugate has been noticeably higher as compared with free drug. The resulted synergistic action confirmed a potentiating effect of the antibiotic. Thus, these findings suggest that polymer-drug conjugate could be an attractive alternative for malaria treatment [53].  Apart from the delivery system, polymer can also generate a potent immune effect by serving as an adjuvant. Scaria et al. have conjugated malaria antigen to a protein carrier, which provided on enhanced immunogenicity of the antigen. Malaria antigen is chemically conjugated with a carrier protein; this forms nanoparticles with greater immunogenicity. They used Pfs25 and Pfs230D1 malaria antigens separately linked to the carrier protein Exoprotein A (EPA) via thioester bond. These nanoparticles provide greater immunogenicity. Various conjugates have been reportedly prepared by using amide, glutaraldehyde, thioester, and ADH chemistry and characterized for Mw distribution, average Mw, and humoral immunogenicity evaluated in mice. The conjugate was 16-73 nm in size. These findings suggest that various carriers and appropriate chemistry can be used for protein-protein conjugation for effective vaccine development [54].  Polymer-based nanocarriers possess added advantages of in vivo drug release control, if they are appropriately sized and material is biodegradable could be further explored for clinical application. Nevertheless, size and surface charge are required to be evaluated for their role in nanotoxicological manifestation before they can be the acceptable drug delivery system. Some of the polymeric-based nanocarriers are summarized in Table 5.   Prodrugs as an antimalarial  Prodrugs are chemically altered inactive drug molecules, which require chemical or enzymatic biotransformation in the body, to release their active parent drug, at the site of action where therapeutic effect is needed. Prodrugs are classified as carrier-linked prodrugs and bioprecursors. The pharmacologically active drug is attached to the carrier by a covalent bond, which is released under in vivo conditions. In contrast, bioprecursors are activated by the metabolic transformations of the functional group. Prodrug strategy is employed where a drug possesses a poor pharmacokinetic profile or where sitespecific targeted delivery is needed. Various physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and biopharmaceutical properties like solubility, chemical stability, bioavailability, permeability, and metabolism are improved by applying prodrug approach [59].  A study carried out by Ismail et al. seems to be an interesting strategy to target iRBCs. They have reported the liposome of dimeric artesunate phospholipid, where one molecule of phospholipid could deliver simultaneously two molecules of artesunate to the iRBCs. The hypothesis is based on the demand of the lipids, which are dramatically increased during the various biological processes of Plasmodium parasite. Hence, infected RBCs can be selectively targeted via this approach. Figure 5 shows a schematic representation of targeting iRBCs via prodrug approach [33].  Some of the important prodrugs of antimalarials are summarized in Table 6.   Protein/nucleic acid-based drug delivery  Peptides exhibit high biocompatibility hence could be the material of choice for preparation of nano-drug delivery system. Curcumin is an antimalarial agent but due to its low solubility and less bioavailability, the in vivo efficacy of the curcumin is c o m p r o m i s e d . A l a m a n d c o w o r k e r s r e p o r t e d dehydrophenylalanine (\\u0394Phe) dipeptide-based self- The solubility of artemether is enhanced. [47] \\u03b2-Artemether SMEDDS Oral  The antimalarial activity was significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) as compared with the marketed formulation (Larither\\u00ae). [48] \\u03b2-Artemether and lumefantrine SMEDDS Oral SMEDDS shows superior antimalarial activity with 100% survival as compared with the innovator (Coartem\\u00ae) formulation.  [49]  Artemether-lumefantrine Solid SMEDDS Oral Optimized SMEDDS formulation at a low, medium, and high doses found to be superior in terms of reduction in parasitemia as well as mortality in comparison with the marketed tablet of equivalent dose. [50] assembled nanoparticles for the delivery of curcumin. For achieving efficient delivery of curcumin, different dipeptides such as phenylalanine-\\u03b1,\\u03b2-dehydrophenylalanine (F\\u0394F), arginine-\\u03b1,\\u03b2-dehydrophenylalanine (R\\u0394F), valine-\\u03b1,\\u03b2dehydrophenylalanine (V\\u0394F), and methonine-\\u03b1,\\u03b2dehydrophenylalanine (M\\u0394F) which were studies for the self-assembly and curcumin loading capacity reveal that out of them F\\u0394F nanotubes exhibit the highest loading capacity nearly 68% w/w and an IC50 value of 3.0 \\u03bcM. Thus, curcumin-loaded F\\u0394Fnanoformulation shows greater parasite inhibition as compared with free curcumin in malaria-infected mice. The biocompatible short peptide-based nanoparticles appear to be an excellent carrier for the loading of hydrophobic antimalarials [62]. CM is one of the most severe forms of infection of P. falciparum. Microvesicles (MV) play an important role in  Chloroquine and azithromycin Nanospheres Combination therapy exhibits synergistic action against Plasmodium in vitro. The formulation could overcome the problem of drug resistance.  [56]  Bisphosphonates Carbon nanospheres (CNSs)  Chloroquine conjugated bisphosphonates carbon nanospheres (CNSs) exhibited excessively high antiparasitic activity parasite killing.  [57]  Artemisinin   Dimers and dendrimers  Antimalarial activity of the dimer and dendrimer was investigated in the P. falciparum 3D7 strain and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and found to be the most active compound as compared with artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, and chloroquine. Trimer is most active against HCMV in vitro replication and has a EC50 value of 0.026 \\u03bcm. [58] the pathogenesis of CM as a marker of severity. These are the submicron vesicles (200-1000 nm diameter) released from the cells in the microvasculature such as platelets, endothelial cells, erythrocyte, and leucocytes. During CM, neurological symptoms are increased as the level of MV increases. MV analysis gives a strong basis, which helps to understand the pathophysiology of CM. miRNA is the small, non-coding single-stranded RNA, which helps to control 30% of protein-coding genes via post-transcriptional regulation and RNA silencing. microRNA within the MV showed to be dysregulated in malaria. Cohen et al. worked on the microRNA cargo of MV to understand the pathogenesis of CM. miRNA changes were recorded in CBA-infected mice with P. berghei ANKA strain and P. yoelii, which are responsible for severe malaria devoid of cerebral complications hence termed as non-CM. A comparison of the MV with healthy and CM mice for miRNA expression using microarrays was made. The results reveal that miRNA plays an important role in inflammation and dysregulation during CM, which is critical for the beginning of neurological syndrome through the regulation of downstream targets [63]. Clinical development of Pfs25 is hindered due to its limited immunogenicity. It is a transmission-blocking vaccine antigen candidate. Thus, to enhance its immunogenicity, recombinant polyhistidine-tagged Pfs25 is mixed with the preformed liposomes which contain cobalt porphyrin-phospholipid; thus at the time of immunization, nanoliposome antigen particleization (SNAP) 762 formation takes place. The antigen is stably presented on phospholipid bilayer, without covalent modification, and hence retains antigen conformation. The histidine-tagged P. falciparum polypeptide was found to induce strong antibody production and could be useful in the preparation of multistage particulate vaccines using SNAP for immunization [64].  Nanobiotechnology product in the market RTS,S (Mosquirix\\u2122) is the first licensed vaccine of malaria that is approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for young children. RTS,S vaccine is active against P. falciparum, which is the most deadly parasite prevalent globally especially in the Africa region. The vaccine has been approved by the WHO for pilot production in the three African countries (Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi). RTS, S activates body immune system to fight against malaria, especially against P. falciparum. RTS,S is designed to arrest the Plasmodium life cycle (infection, maturation, and multiplication) in the liver [65].  In RTS,S vaccine \\\"R\\\" stands for central repeat region of P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP); \\\"T\\\" stands for a T cell epitope of circumsporozoite protein, and \\\"S\\\" stands for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). It forms a single fusion protein (\\\"RTS\\\") and it is further co-expressed within the yeast vector with free HBsAg. \\\"RTS, S\\\" particles are formed by the spontaneous assembly of the \\\"RTS\\\" fusion protein and free \\\"S\\\" protein. The vaccine also contains adjuvants to enhance the immunogenicity; here, AS01 is used as a adjuvant and hence referred as \\\"RTS,S/AS01\\\" [66].  Adjuvants are added to achieve the desired adaptive immune system. It is defined as functional excipients, possesses a heterogeneous group of compounds, and can be divided into Prodrug did not improve in vivo efficacy but improved drug exposure with oral dosing and longer half-life is achieved. [60] bis-N-Alkylamidines Amidoxime derivatives as a prodrug Choline Amidoxime prodrug significantly improves oral antimalarial activity. [61] two broad category delivery systems or immunostimulators. Delivery systems include liposome, emulsion droplets, and immune-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs). Patternrecognition receptors (PPRs) are expressed on the antigen-presenting cells (APCs), for which co-delivery of antigen on the immunostimulator acts as a ligand. Adjuvant based on the liposomes for subunit vaccine and as immunopotentiator is multifaceted and can be customized combining (a) changing lipid composition, (b) mode of antigen and immunostimulatory association, and (c) addition of immunostimulator. Liposomes act as an adjuvant by their ability to interact with the antigen-presenting cells and increase the exposure of immunostimulator and antigen to the APCs [67].   Future prospects of nanobiotechnology  Nanobiotechnology is an emerging area of research and application being explored for its potential applications to obscure and address drug and drug delivery-related problems. Seemingly, it can improvise the existing conventional drug delivery modules and also it can improve the therapeutic outcome of the drug discernibly and may allow curtailing down the contraindicated manifestations well below the tolerable limits. Most of the nano biotechnological have demonstrated improved and effective performance at preclinical stages. However, the results at the end have been discouraging due to toxicological and interactive manifestations of such drug delivery systems. There appears to be a gap between preclinical and clinical phases inviting intensive, consistent, and sincere attention of researchers to logistically design and develop the systems for their safe and effective use. It is appreciated that the molecular interplay involved in the malaria parasite invasion and its subsequent proliferation and molecular mechanistic involved therein can open up the vistas of multiple options, opportunity, potential, and promises based on molecular events and judicious intervention thereon, which could only be possible through nanobiotechnological stratagems. The target (infected RBCs) could be selectively delivered with a load of drug which could not only eradicate the parasitemia but also the problem associated with drug resistance that emerges due to sub-therapeutic drug exposure. The nanobiotechnology may include the use of site-directing antibodies, aberrant and variant expression of protein determinant on infected cells, biodevices developed as a variant, and bioprocesses and also the smart material which could be developed by structuring a drug/drug(s) carrier selective or with proficiency to the target site. Adding to the proposed possibilities, the molecular modifications as nutrient-based prodrug and antimetabolites could be other possible diversities that can be brought in place in the designing, development, and tailoring of drug delivery systems for exclusive use in cellselective targeted drug delivery.   Conclusion  Scientific innovations, development, and international collaboration have increased the ability for effective treatment of malaria and understanding of etiology at the molecular level. Nanobiotechnology provides various opportunities, which could improve conventional malaria therapy. Poor solubility, low oral bioavailability, toxicity, chemical instability, poor pharmacokinetic properties, the short half-life of the drug, drug resistance, and non-specific drug targeting are the main d r a w b a c k s o f c o n v e n t i o n a l t h e r a p y. H o w e v e r, nanobiotechnology overcomes the abovementioned shortcomings to some extent. The journey ahead is long to recognize an effective combination of molecules, which will enhance therapeutic indices and devoid of side effects. Safety and scalability are two important parameters for targeted antimalarial therapy. Liposomes, especially PEGylated liposomes, seem to be an effective drug delivery system for incorporating antimalarial drugs. The polymeric nanocarriers are less exploited for malaria. Surface modification of the nanocarriers may improve the drug targeting and efficacy of the treatment. The nanobiotechnology thus may help design the smart, well-tolerated, low cost, and effective therapeutic drug delivery systems for the complete eradication of malaria.

There are many sources of pollution, and they are distributed in different ways on our planet. However, air pollutants emitted in one country can be transported into the atmosphere, affecting air quality elsewhere. Suspended particulate matter (PMx), nitrogen dioxide, and tropospheric ozone are considered the three pollutants that most significantly affect human health [3]. For these reasons, PMx measurement is very important, and can be performed using various direct analytical instruments, such as impact samplers and analytical balances [4]. In recent years, systems and sensors for the analysis (or counting) of microparticles or microspheres have been the focus of numerous studies. For the assay, coated microspheres provide a measuring tool in biology and drug research [5]. In buoyancy, hollow microspheres (made of glass and polymer) are used to decrease material density in plastics. For ceramic filter manufacturing, microspheres of polyethylene are used to obtain controlled porosity [6]. In particular, in the field of research for developing PM monitoring devices, monodisperse microspheres are used to calibrate particle sieves, optical particle counters (OPCs), and other kinds of sensors [7]. Generally, OPC performances are comparable when they are used to count particles. On the other hand, the algorithms used to convert the counting into a mass concentration differ from manufacturer to manufacturer. In fact, parameters such as refractive index and particle shape influence their mass estimation. Therefore, the optical measurement has an intrinsic discrepancy when compared to the more accurate direct gravimetric methods [8]. For these reasons, we focused our attention on quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs), which are one of the most commonly used mass sensors for the development of sensory systems designed to measure gases, molecules, particles, and contaminants in a wide range of applications, such as environmental monitoring [9], medical assays, and space applications [10][11][12][13]. QCMs are piezoelectric oscillating-based sensors capable of converting changes in thickness/mass of the deposited material on their electrodes into a frequency shift. QCMs are still being studied as one of the most reliable methods of measurement and analysis for particulate matter in general [14][15][16]. In fact, in PM monitoring, a QCM can measure the mass of the particles collected on its electrodes by providing, for example, the total of PM or fractions such as PM2.5 or PM10 in cascade-type impact meters [17]. Separation or filtering systems [18] and one or more QCM are therefore used to obtain information on the different dimensions of the particulate. Currently, this type of system can be miniaturized, but it poses extreme difficulties given the current state of microfluidics, mechanical, or 3D machining processes [19]. In recent years, QCMs have been at the center of numerous research studies applied to the measurement of the dimensions of microspheres in various fields of application; in fact, many works use them not only as mass sensors, but also as actual transducers for complex analyses of tribology [20,21]. Some scientific works use concepts of energy dissipation of the vibration generated on the surface of the QCM to analyze the type of bond the particle forms with the electrode surface, often functionalized [22]. Other research groups modify the surface of the QCM by building mechanical structures, such as micropillars, that act as mechanical resonators and, when coupled with particles of the correct size, produce changes in the frequency of the QCM distinguishable from the simple signal of an increase in mass or thickness [23]. However, it would be very interesting to be able to use QCMs to measure, at the same time, the mass of particles collected on the surface and perform dimensional analysis. This would prevent PM monitoring systems, based on mass sensors, from always having to use complex or cumbersome dimensional separation systems. In 1971, a study by Olin and Sem [24] was useful in understanding how to write a relationship between the response of a QCM, the resonance frequency, and the amplitude of the vibration when microparticles are deposited on its surface. In this paper, we present an experiment aimed at studying the possible effects that occur on the response of a QCM to different measurements of microspheres when the amplitude of the vibration varies. To simplify the tests, we used borosilicate microspheres, which are usually used in aerosol generators, for atmospheric PM simulation. In detail, we conducted tests on various QCMs, which had three distinct fundamental resonant frequencies (10, 5, 2.5 MHz), measuring the response obtained for two samples of microspheres, 2 and 10 \\u00b5m in diameter, and varying the amplitude of the vibration.  We have obtained encouraging results by developing a circuit capable of controlling the amplitude of the oscillation, acting on the QCM driving current. In particular, with a QCM of 2.5 MHz, we can detect only the mass of the 2 \\u00b5m microspheres, even when 10 \\u00b5m microspheres are present. This result confirms Olin and Sem's study, and could allow the development of a QCM-based system for continuous mass and size analysis of collected particulate matter.    Methods and Materials   Frequency and Driving Force Effects  According to Sauerbrey's experimental assumption, the resonant frequency decreases linearly with the addition of foreign mass on the crystal surface: \\u2206 f = \\u2212 2 f o 2 A \\u221a v q \\u03c1 q \\u2206m = \\u2212 C f A \\u2206m(1) In this equation (Equation (1)), \\u2206f refers to the frequency shift due to the changing mass \\u2206m. C f represents a constant, where f 0 is the fundamental resonating frequency, v q is the velocity of propagation of transverse wave in the plane of the quartz, \\u03c1 q is the density of the quartz, and A is the effective area of the electrode [25].  Although the Sauerbrey assumption is applicable for particles and thin films, some differences in the QCM response were observed due to particles that may have relatively more movement between adjacent particulate layers, causing more energy dissipation [26]. Generally, a particle on a QCM must adhere to the vibrating surface with enough force to counteract the inertia forces to be detected [24,[27][28][29].  The inertia force F I acting on a spherical particle of diameter D p and density \\u03c1 p is defined as: F I = \\u03c1 P \\u03c0 6 \\u03b2I(2\\u03c0 f 0 ) 2 D p 3 (2) where \\u03b2I is the crystal vibration amplitude for a fixed driving current I, and f 0 is the crystal fundamental resonating frequency (\\u03b2 is a constant for a given crystal). The particle adhesion force (F A ) on the surface can be written as: F A = \\u00b5\\u03bbD p(3) where \\u00b5 is the friction coefficient and \\u03bb is a constant depending on the interaction forces between the surface and the particle. When the forces are balanced (F A = F I ), combining Equations (2) and (3), we obtain a critical diameter D crit (for a fixed frequency and a set driving current I): D crit = 3\\u00b5\\u03bb 2\\u03c0 3 \\u03c1 P \\u03b2 1 I 1/2 f 0(4) Equation (4) shows that when F I \\u2264 F A , a particle adheres to the QCM surface, resulting in D p \\u2264 D crit , and it can be detected. On the other hand, it cannot be detected when F I > F A because a particle tends to dislodge from the surface (D p > D crit ). For these reasons, varying the current and frequency makes it possible to change the QCM response to a fixed particle diameter. In order to detect bigger particles, the product I\\u00b7f 0 should be minimized. However, there are physical limits for the driving current and resonating frequency. In particular, the current cannot be less than I Limit (the value required to sustain a stable oscillation), and at the same time, a decreasing resonant frequency produces a QCM response (or sensitivity) reduction.   Reagents and Methods  The chemicals used to prepare the samples, which included three dispersions and one solution, were polyvinylpyrrolidone (MW 1300 kDa, CAS number: 9000-39-8), absolute ethanol (CAS number: 64-17-5) purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), and borosilicate glass microspheres with mean diameters of 2 \\u00b5m and 10 \\u00b5m (traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology) purchased from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) (Cat.no:9002, Cat.no:9010).  Three different dispersions were prepared using absolute ethanol (EtOH) as liquid phase [30]. MS 10  1.4 mg of 2 \\u00b5m microspheres in 10 mL of EtOH, resulting in concentrations of 0.42 \\u00b5g/\\u00b5L and 0.28 \\u00b5g/\\u00b5L, respectively. These dispersions were used to test the response of QCMs using a drop-casting technique, depositing a volume of 1 \\u00b5L on their surface. Before each deposition, the dispersions were sonicated in an ultrasound bath for 3 min to avoid precipitation. In addition, to compare the influence of oscillation amplitude on the QCM response in the presence of a polymeric homogenous film versus microsphere dispersions, a PVP solution (PVP sol ) was prepared using EtOH as solvent (0.18 \\u00b5g/\\u00b5L).  Using an optical microscope (Leica DM2700 M) with an objective of 100\\u00d7/0.85 magnification and a field of view of 22 mm, it was possible to observe three depositions of borosilicate microspheres in the different dispersions (MS 10 , MS 2 , MS MIX ) on a quartz crystal slice, as shown in Figure 1. of EtOH (0.30 \\u00b5g/\\u00b5L), and MSMIX contained 2.1 mg of 10 \\u00b5m microspheres and 1.4 mg of 2 \\u00b5m microspheres in 10 mL of EtOH, resulting in concentrations of 0.42 \\u00b5g/\\u00b5L and 0.28 \\u00b5g/\\u00b5L, respectively.

Using an optical microscope (Leica DM2700 M) with an objective of 100x/0.85 magnification and a field of view of 22 mm, it was possible to observe three depositions of borosilicate microspheres in the different dispersions (MS10, MS2, MSMIX) on a quartz crystal slice, as shown in Figure 1. Three types of QCMs (10 MHz, 5 MHz, and 2.5 MHz of resonance frequency) were used, each with a different gold-coated electrode size (d = 5.9 mm, d = 6.3 mm, d = 5.0 mm, respectively), to evaluate the changes in responses due to variations in the fundamental frequency (as shown in Equation (4)). Moreover, we used a specific QCM (with a fixed fundamental frequency) to measure the response of each sample (MS10, MS2, MSMIX, PVPsol), using three levels of driving current, ILOW, IMED, and IH (to change the oscillation amplitude).   Measurement Setup  A block diagram of the measurement setup used during all of the experiments is represented in Figure 2A. A micropipette (PIPETMAN P2, variable volume 0.2-2.0 \\u00b5L, Serial N. KB29151) was used to deposit the sample of microsphere dispersion onto the QCM electrode by drop-casting. To simplify and reduce some errors, due to mechanical aspects, the micropipette was mechanically fixed on a robust stand during all depositions.  As previously described, we used three different QCMs to carry out all of the presented tests. To operate, a QCM needs to be connected to an oscillator circuit that sustains the oscillation conditions [31].

In Figure 2B, we have a photograph of the measurement setup where the highlighted QCM sensor (in particular, a 10 MHz crystal is in the photo) is connected to an oscillator circuit and to the main electronic unit, both enclosed in a single box (red one). A developed software controlled the measurement acquisitions and set all experimental parameters.

A developed software controlled the measurement acquisitions and set all experimental parameters.  In this work, we used a suitable QCM oscillator circuit capable of sustaining the oscillation, and to set the crystal current (oscillator with amplitude control circuit, AC-OSC). Although in this paper we will not go into detail on how it works from an electronics point of view (as the circuit is under patent), the AC-OSC consists of two main parts, each working separately to sustain the oscillation (part a) and to control the amplitude of vibration by changing the oscillation current (part b). As already mentioned above, there is a lower limit current (ILimit) required for a stable oscillation, which depends on different QCM parameters (e.g., drive power level limit). In all of the experiments, we used three different setpoints of current for each QCM: low amplitude (Low), medium amplitude (Med), and high amplitude (High) correlated to the crystal current. In particular, about 0.9 mA, 1.8 mA, and 3.5 mA were used for the low, medium, and high amplitude, respectively (the crystal current is expressed by its root mean square value-RMS).  The main electronic unit (MEU) consisted of a microcontroller that managed all of the measurement phases, setting the driving current, acquiring the signal (fout) with a LOD of \\u00b1 3 Hz, and sending the measurement data to the PC unit for plotting and storage. Environmental information, such as temperature and relative humidity, were measured by a DHT22 sensor connected to \\u00b5C serial bus.   Results and Discussions  In the beginning, different depositions of the same volumes of PVPsol and MS10 on QCMs were performed to confirm the linear behavior of the Sauerbrey equation (Equation (1)). Examples of the obtained results, in the case of the 2.5 MHz crystal, are shown in Figures 3 and 4. To simplify the arrangement of the plot in all chronograms shown in this paper, we have not reported the dynamic behavior of the response |\\u0394f| during the dropcasting deposition.

To simplify the arrangement of the plot in all chronograms shown in this paper, we have not reported the dynamic behavior of the response |\\u2206f | during the dropcasting deposition. In fact, at the beginning of the deposition (t 0 ), the response fluctuated between 1 and 2 kHz, and returned stable (t 1 ) after tens of seconds. These phenomena could have been produced by the injection pressure and liquid phase of the samples. To highlight this time interval, we have introduced two oblique lines \\\"//\\\" in the plot, and only in the first have we indicated both t 0 and t 1 instants for each deposition. between 1 and 2 kHz, and returned stable (t1) after tens of seconds.

To highlight the results, only a single deposition example will be shown for each value of the set oscillation amplitude (Low, Med, High) in all of the following chronograms.   Homogeneous Film of PVP Deposition  Ten tests of a single deposition of PVPsol (1 \\u00b5L) were performed to investigate the effects of amplitude variations on the response of the QCMs. The results of all tests are summarized in the histograms in Figure 5. The same test procedure was executed for all three dispersions (MS2, MS10, and MSMIX). between 1 and 2 kHz, and returned stable (t1) after tens of seconds.

Homogeneous Film of PVP Deposition  Ten tests of a single deposition of PVP sol (1 \\u00b5L) were performed to investigate the effects of amplitude variations on the response of the QCMs. The results of all tests are summarized in the histograms in Figure 5. The same test procedure was executed for all three dispersions (MS 2 , MS 10 , and MS MIX ). In Figure S1 of the Supplementary Materials, we report an example of the results obtained after PVPsol deposition on 10 MHz, 5 MHz, and 2.5 MHz crystals, carried out at low, medium, and high amplitude values. When the driving force varies (due to changes in amplitude), frequency shifts are significantly similar for each QCM. No differences in calculated mass (Equation (1)) were observed, despite varying resonance frequency and amplitude levels. The theoretical mass value (180 ng) is very close to the experimental masses obtained, according to PVPsol concentration. The results are summarized in Table  S1 of the Supplementary Materials. These data are in agreement with the thin film behavior reported in the literature [32][33][34][35]. Thin films are deposited as homogeneous layers onto the QCM electrode, and the frequency changes are related to an increase in mass, as predicted by the Sauerbrey equation (Equation (1)). In this experiment, the deposition on the electrode of the same volume of PVP leads to the formation of a homogeneous layer. The response does not vary appreciably by changing the f0 and the amplitude. Table 1 shows the average values of frequency calculated from all of the tests performed.    MS2 (Microspheres of 2 \\u00b5m) and MS10 (Microspheres of 10 \\u00b5m)  Examples of chronograms for MS2 dispersions are shown in Figure S2 in the Supplementary Materials for QCMs operating at 10 MHz (A), 5 MHz (B), and 2.5 MHz (C) frequencies, with low, medium, and high amplitudes. Even in this case, a behavior similar In Figure S1 of the Supplementary Materials, we report an example of the results obtained after PVP sol deposition on 10 MHz, 5 MHz, and 2.5 MHz crystals, carried out at low, medium, and high amplitude values.

The response does not vary appreciably by changing the f 0 and the amplitude. Table 1 shows the average values of frequency calculated from all of the tests performed.  to PVP sol can be observed at the amplitude variation. Frequency changes are related to very similar experimental masses when different QCMs are used, according to MS 2 concentration. These results are reported in Table S2. No notable changes in the frequency variation were observed by modulating the amplitude for each sensor. According to Equation (4), the particle diameter could be below the critical dimension for these three different levels (D p = 2 \\u00b5m < D crit ). We have evaluated the deposited mass for each QCM by Equation (1), taking into account the fundamental resonating frequency (10 MHz, 5 MHz, 2.5 MHz) [36] and the frequency shifts (|\\u2206f |) reported in Table S2. The calculated mass values were in the range of 256.6 ng to 329.5 ng, with tens of nanograms of deviation from a theoretical mass of 300 ng. Examples of chronograms for MS 10 dispersions are shown in Figure S3 in the Supplementary Materials for QCMs operating at 10 MHz (A), 5 MHz (B), and 2.5 MHz (C) frequencies with low, medium, and high amplitudes. The frequency shifts (|\\u2206f|) are reported in Table S3.  Ten tests were performed both for MS 2 and MS 10 , aiming to compare the results summarized in Figure 6. The histograms were constructed by considering the comparison between the depositions of MS 2 and MS 10 on each microbalance, achieved by modifying the amplitude. to PVPsol can be observed at the amplitude variation. Frequency changes are related to very similar experimental masses when different QCMs are used, according to MS2 concentration. These results are reported in Table S2. No notable changes in the frequency variation were observed by modulating the amplitude for each sensor. According to Equation (4), the particle diameter could be below the critical dimension for these three different levels (Dp = 2 \\u00b5m < Dcrit). We have evaluated the deposited mass for each QCM by Equation (1), taking into account the fundamental resonating frequency (10 MHz, 5 MHz, 2.5 MHz) [36] and the frequency shifts (|\\u0394f|) reported in Table S2. The calculated mass values were in the range of 256.6 ng to 329.5 ng, with tens of nanograms of deviation from a theoretical mass of 300 ng. Examples of chronograms for MS10 dispersions are shown in Figure S3 in the Supplementary Materials for QCMs operating at 10 MHz (A), 5 MHz (B), and 2.5 MHz (C) frequencies with low, medium, and high amplitudes. The frequency shifts (|\\u0394f|) are reported in Table S3. Ten tests were performed both for MS2 and MS10, aiming to compare the results summarized in Figure 6. The histograms were constructed by considering the comparison between the depositions of MS2 and MS10 on each microbalance, achieved by modifying the amplitude. In Figure 6A, the statistical dispersion of MS2 (blue) confirms that the average frequency variations are related to the concentration of the dispersion where Dp = 2 \\u00b5m < Dcrit, as expected. No response to any amplitudes is observed on the 10 MHz QCM (purple). As explained in Section 2.1, and as known from the literature [37][38][39], for lower coupling and larger dimensions, the particles are not able to follow the movement with the vibrations of the QCM. On the contrary, for strong coupling and smaller mass, the particles move with the vibrational surface of the QCM. Since the gold surface of the QCM and the borosilicate microspheres do not establish chemical bonds on the contact surface, the adhesion force depends mostly on the particle diameter and friction coefficient (Equation (2)). Experiments for this resonance frequency and the three modulated amplitude oscillations show a particular condition where particle diameter is larger than the critical dimension (Dp = 10 \\u00b5m > Dcrit). In Figure 6A, the statistical dispersion of MS 2 (blue) confirms that the average frequency variations are related to the concentration of the dispersion where D p = 2 \\u00b5m < D crit , as expected. No response to any amplitudes is observed on the 10 MHz QCM (purple). As explained in Section 2.1, and as known from the literature [37][38][39], for lower coupling and larger dimensions, the particles are not able to follow the movement with the vibrations of the QCM. On the contrary, for strong coupling and smaller mass, the particles move with the vibrational surface of the QCM. Since the gold surface of the QCM and the borosilicate microspheres do not establish chemical bonds on the contact surface, the adhesion force depends mostly on the particle diameter and friction coefficient (Equation (2)). Experiments for this resonance frequency and the three modulated amplitude oscillations show a particular condition where particle diameter is larger than the critical dimension (D p = 10 \\u00b5m > D crit ).  In Figure 6B, the average frequency variations (\\u2206 f ) are plotted as a function of the amplitudes on the 5 MHz QCM for ten tests carried out. Blue histograms represent the data found on MS 2 tests, where these average frequencies are once again in agreement with the concentration of the dispersion. There is a possibility that this resonance frequency is critical for MS 10 , where a strong dependence on the levels of amplitude has been observed (D p~1 0 \\u00b5m). In the same way, the purple histograms show a decrease in average frequency variations (\\u2206 f = 16 Hz) when the high level is used (fewer and smaller particles are detected), while the histograms show an increase (\\u2206 f = 53 Hz) when a lower level of amplitude is applied (more and bigger particles are measured), according to Equation (4). Figure 6C shows the results of \\u2206 f obtained at different levels of oscillation amplitude on the 2.5 MHz QCM. Blue histograms (MS 2 ) show no significant differences in the response when modulating the amplitude. All of the tests with MS 10 showed that the response depends on the amplitude value. In fact, for high and medium levels, no response was observed because D p > D crit , while for low levels D p < D crit , a response was obtained. The average frequency variation obtained (65 Hz) was identifiable to the deposited mass (calculated mass was 908.7 \\u00b1 74.6 ng). The average frequency variations obtained from the histograms are summarized in Table 2.    MS MIX (Microsphere Mix)  Examples of chronograms for MS MIX dispersions are shown in Figure S4 in the Supplementary Materials for QCMs operating at 10 MHz (A), 5 MHz (B), and 2.5 MHz (C) frequencies, with low, medium, and high amplitudes. The measured frequency shifts are reported in Table S4. In order to compare the results obtained for MS 10 and MS 2 , ten tests were performed for MS MIX . In Figure 7, we report the histograms of results on each microbalance, achieved by modifying the amplitude.  Figure 7A shows statistical data of tests on a 10 MHz QCM. Considering the responses previously obtained for MS2 and MS10 dispersions, frequency variations should be assigned to the 2 \\u00b5m microspheres because no response was observed for MS10 (Dp = 10 \\u00b5m > Dcrit). This outcome is consistent with the previous discussion (Section 3.2); the average frequency variations (Table 3) are related to the concentration of these particles in MSMIX. In the same way, Figure 7B reports the results of MSMIX on a 5 MHz QCM, where a critical dimensional condition for MS10 is observed (Dcrit around 10 \\u00b5m), and a strong dependence on the level of oscillation amplitude is shown. For this reason, when high and medium levels are used, the value of Dcrit decreases, and the average frequency variations are related to 2 \\u00b5m microspheres and smaller particles in the dimensional distribution of 10 \\u00b5m in MSMIX. For low levels, the value of Dcrit increases, and 2 \\u00b5m microspheres with larger particles of 10 \\u00b5m in MSMIX are detected.  Finally, Figure 7C shows histograms of the tests performed on the 2.5 MHz QCM. The average frequency variation observed should be attributed to the 2 \\u00b5m microspheres in MSMIX, because no response was observed for 10 \\u00b5m particles (Dp = 10 \\u00b5m > Dcrit) at high and medium levels. However, for low amplitude, the condition where Dp = 10 \\u00b5m < Dcrit was observed, and 2 \\u00b5m and 10 \\u00b5m microspheres in MSMIX were detected together. The average frequency variations obtained from the histograms are summarized in Table 3.   Figure 7A shows statistical data of tests on a 10 MHz QCM. Considering the responses previously obtained for MS 2 and MS 10 dispersions, frequency variations should be assigned to the 2 \\u00b5m microspheres because no response was observed for MS 10 (D p = 10 \\u00b5m > D crit ). This outcome is consistent with the previous discussion (Section 3.2); the average frequency variations (Table 3) are related to the concentration of these particles in MS MIX . In the same way, Figure 7B reports the results of MS MIX on a 5 MHz QCM, where a critical dimensional condition for MS 10 is observed (D crit around 10 \\u00b5m), and a strong dependence on the level of oscillation amplitude is shown. For this reason, when high and medium levels are used, the value of D crit decreases, and the average frequency variations are related to 2 \\u00b5m microspheres and smaller particles in the dimensional distribution of 10 \\u00b5m in MS MIX . For low levels, the value of D crit increases, and 2 \\u00b5m microspheres with larger particles of 10 \\u00b5m in MS MIX are detected.  Finally, Figure 7C shows histograms of the tests performed on the 2.5 MHz QCM. The average frequency variation observed should be attributed to the 2 \\u00b5m microspheres in MS MIX , because no response was observed for 10 \\u00b5m particles (D p = 10 \\u00b5m > D crit ) at high and medium levels. However, for low amplitude, the condition where D p = 10 \\u00b5m < D crit was observed, and 2 \\u00b5m and 10 \\u00b5m microspheres in MS MIX were detected together. The average frequency variations obtained from the histograms are summarized in Table 3.    Conclusions  In this paper, we study the effects of oscillation amplitude variations and fundamental frequency value on the QCM response, when particle matter of different sizes is deposited on the electrodes. Four different samples were prepared (PVP sol , MS 2 , MS 10 , and MS MIX ). From the literature, it is known that the detection of microspheres is influenced by resonant frequency (f 0 ) and crystal vibration amplitude (\\u03b2I). When D p < D crit , a particle adheres to the QCM surface and can be detected. On the contrary, when D p > D crit , a particle tends to slip from the surface. For the solution of PVP, no appreciable changes in responses with varying QCMs and amplitude levels were observed, according to homogenous film behavior. Similar performances to PVP sol were observed for MS 2 dispersion because the particle diameter is reasonably under the critical dimension (D p = 2 \\u00b5m < D crit ). For MS 10 , no response to any oscillation amplitude level was observed on the 10 MHz QCM. When the particle diameter overcomes the critical diameter (D p = 10 \\u00b5m > D crit ), the oscillation returns to the fundamental frequency after tens of seconds. A critical resonance frequency was assumed for the 5 MHz QCM, where D crit was around 10 \\u00b5m. The response was worsened when a high level of amplitude was applied, and improved when a low level was used. The response of the 2.5 MHz QCM to MS 10 depended strongly on the applied amplitude levels: high and medium intensities showed D p > D crit , while for the low level D p < D crit , and 10 \\u00b5m microspheres were detected. In the case of MS MIX , the responses on the 10 MHz QCM should be assigned to the 2 \\u00b5m microspheres (D p = 10 \\u00b5m > D crit ). More elaborate is the case on the 5 MHz QCM, where D crit was around 10 \\u00b5m and strong frequency variations were observed when different oscillation amplitude levels were applied. On the 2.5 MHz QCM for high and medium levels, the responses should be assigned to the 2 \\u00b5m microspheres because no response was observed for 10 \\u00b5m particles. For low levels, 2 \\u00b5m and 10 \\u00b5m microspheres were measured together due to the condition where D p = 10 \\u00b5m < D crit was observed. To validate the study carried out in this paper, it would be suitable to study intermediate conditions, considering resonance frequencies from 5 MHz to 2.5 MHz, where microspheres have a dimension between 2 \\u00b5m and 10 \\u00b5m for better estimation of the critical diameter value. This experiment's results have shown that by changing the oscillation amplitude and fundamental resonant frequency, it is possible to use a single QCM (e.g., 10 MHz) to measure only 2 \\u00b5m particles when both 2 and 10 \\u00b5m are collected on the QCM electrode. On the other hand, with a 2.5 MHz QCM, it is possible to measure both particles or only 2 \\u00b5m, if the amplitude oscillation is changed. These results could be used to develop a QCM array-based monitoring system to carry out particle dimensional analysis, using amplitude modulation.
